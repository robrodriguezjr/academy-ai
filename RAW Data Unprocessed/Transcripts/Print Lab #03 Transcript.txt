00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Mildred Salas Yip: Hi Robert! Can you hear me? I don't hear you.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Now you should.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Mildred Salas Yip: I.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Thank you, I said. By the way, I said, Hello, welcome. How's everybody doing?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Mildred Salas Yip: Good.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Awesome. Yeah.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
michellecambier: Raining all day in New York, in Long Island.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, it's it's rainy here as well. Yeah.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Jerry Stachowski: Well, it's snowy in Colorado, so.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Ah!

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Mildred Salas Yip: Oh, nice!

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Mildred Salas Yip: I love the cold.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
michellecambier: I'm from the tropics.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Well, Mildred, that's something you and I do not have in common.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Mildred Salas Yip: You don't like the cold, Robert.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Well um. I do like the cold like. Psychologically, I like the cold. I like the winter. I like the snow. I like the change of season. All that. My body doesn't like the cold.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
michellecambier: Right. That's me.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Mildred Salas Yip: Yes, yes.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So I can't keep my! I can't keep my body warm like if I go out. My hands, my feet. They're just freezing, but I enjoy it, you know, so I don't know that I would be happy in a place that was always warm, because I love the change of season like right now the cold to spring. But my body as I've gotten older I don't know. So.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Mildred Salas Yip: Yeah, I'd like I. This is what I tell everyone. I love the cold. I just don't like being cold.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah. Well, there you go. Then I then I agree with you. 100%.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Mildred Salas Yip: Yes, yes.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000
michellecambier: And I don't like the aches that come with a cold.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Mildred Salas Yip: But the truth is.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, well, yeah.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Mildred Salas Yip: Yeah. But I think that part of the trick to that is wearing layers.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Mildred Salas Yip: And I don't think that we we properly layer up because we're only thinking about convenience.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah. Well, trust me. I lay her up.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Mildred Salas Yip: Well, you know it's interesting. I've only been in the mid Hudson Valley for about 5 years, and the cold here is not the same as the cold in Manhattan. And I think it's because of the wind and the buildings.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Hmm.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Mildred Salas Yip: So there you have to dress with layers and a lot of things, because you're fighting the wind. Somehow up here. It's cold.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Mildred Salas Yip: But it's not intolerable.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Well, that's why that's why I don't go to the city in the wintertime. Okay.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
michellecambier: You were born in the city, Robert, where.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I was. Yeah, I'm a native New Yorker. Yes.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
michellecambier: Oh!

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Mildred Salas Yip: Who am I?

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Mildred Salas Yip: I was born in Manhattan. Where were you born?

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Bronx. Yeah.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Mildred Salas Yip: The Bronx.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
michellecambier: I went to high school in the Bronx and Junior High School in the Bronx.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Wow! Awesome. Yeah. Small world, as they always say.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Mildred Salas Yip: And you're out in Long Island, Michelle.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
michellecambier: Yeah, I'm from Brooklyn, normally from Park Slope, Brooklyn. But uh.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Mildred Salas Yip: Oh, me too!

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
michellecambier: Yeah. 5, th Street.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Mildred Salas Yip: What part of park, slope.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
michellecambier: 5th Street, by Methodist Hospital.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Mildred Salas Yip: Oh, I was on Sterling.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000
michellecambier: Okay, that's a gorgeous area starting. Yeah.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:42.000
Mildred Salas Yip: Yeah, on early, 7.th Yeah. My mom, my mom moved in 1978 to Park Slope, on 13th Street and 6th Avenue.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:50.000
michellecambier: Okay. So I, when I moved to the Bronx, when I moved to Brooklyn from the Bronx, I lived on 11th and 7th Avenue.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Mildred Salas Yip: Nice. That's a nice area. It's it's always hopping around there.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
michellecambier: Yeah. Well, now it is.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Mildred Salas Yip: Ah, okay.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Welcome, Don. Good to see you, Howard. Karen Kerwick, Mark, Richard.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000
donaldboyd: Hi Robert!

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Virginia. Welcome Jerry. Um. And welcome. Carl. Nice to see all of you here as well. How do I? All right. So I think we'll get started today. For those who are new to the print lab. This is our 3.rd Print lab running. So this is a series that I started. A couple couple months ago. The idea was.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I love printing. I know a lot of our members love printing as well. And I do talk about it during our normal live sessions. But printing really is its own. Sort of subject entirely. So I decided to start a new. Monthly for now, and we'll see how it goes as we move forward. But monthly session, where we just talk about printing. And this way we can really go deep in all the areas of printing and. Separated out a little bit from the normal sessions, and if we get a theme running here, which is what I'm trying to do, then. We can carry that forward so that. You're building on your knowledge of printing, or we're addressing questions or challenges. New things coming up, etcetera.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:06:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In our 1st session. 2 months ago. Print lab number one. That was really just an overview of. Printing in general, and I wanted to hear from you guys what kinds of challenges you were having and your experiences with printing. So it was really a nice conversation about. Printing in general, but I did hear, as I said then, some common themes about the. Challenges with printing things like color management. Things like colors, not quite matching, or prints too dark. Of course, paper choices that's always an important aspect of it, deciding what paper to use or. Thinking about how the paper can. Be used as a creative tool to complement your image.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Of course, there's the technical side. What software you're using, etc. So I shared a. I shared a screen, or, I should say, a graphic. That time. Really, describing. Or laying out a general framework for. A printing workflow right from your capture. Through your adjustments in lightroom. And then paper selection here, because the paper selection, then.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Sort of dictates what you're going to do after that, right? So once you decide on the paper based on the image, then. You're going to do certain optimizations if you need to, for the paper. And then you're going to lay out your print in the. In this case, lightroom. And then you make your print, and so. In our print. Lab number 2. We mostly talked about paper. Because. That's always a fun topic to talk about, and I also got to show some of my prints and talk about the process, etcetera. Today I was hoping, at least from my part, to talk about.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This aspect over here, so a little bit more technical in terms of. Um going through the most important. Parts, or the most important settings in the lightroom print, module. Particularly with color management and also with resolution, because those are 2 areas that can be somewhat confusing. Or a little bit ambiguous. And and then we'll see where it goes from there. But that's more or less what I wanted to cover today. And of course I'm making. Somewhat of an assumption that all of us are using lightroom. To print our images, and.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Generally speaking, I think most people are, and if you aren't, if you're using something like photo. If you're managing your images in Lightroom. But you're using Photoshop to print. Then I can make a pretty good case. Why, you may want to do your like your printing right out of lightroom, because. You're going to get the same pipeline you're going to get the same. Um. Let's say I mean, certainly you're going to get the same quality. But lightroom, of course, gives you many advantages over Photoshop from the point of view of. Flexibility, saving your settings so that you don't have to repeat the same settings over and over again, which. Number one that makes for a more consistent and efficient workflow. Number 2 that eliminates things like Murphy's law. Right? Because if something can go wrong it will. The more you are making changes.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:09:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And in lightroom you can save those settings out. And that you can also do other things with the print module. That you can't quite do in Photoshop so easily. So making layouts. For example, triptychs where you take one image and you split it up into 3 pieces or. Putting 2 images on a single piece of paper things like that. So I'll share a little bit of that today. But I wanted to get through at least the core. Aspects of printing. In terms of the technical from resolution, and also. Color management, um. And this may be something that some of you are familiar with already, but.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: As far as I'm concerned, it's always good to go over these things. And make sure that everything is on a solid footing, because. That is. Going to lead to more consistency in terms of your printing. And when you have problems, when you run into an issue. When color's off, or you don't get the results you expect. And you have a fairly consistent workflow. It's easy to. Sort of troubleshoot, and figure out what's wrong. Whereas, if the variables are always changing.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:10:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Then you can see how that becomes much more complicated. Before I do that, though, before I get into. Sharing some of that here. I just wanted to open up the 1st couple minutes in case anyone has any questions about printing any question whatsoever. Again. The idea behind the print lab is. I want this to be more of a conversation between all of us, and we can just chat about printing in general. If you got any questions. Any um? Challenges that you want to share, that you haven't shared already, or anything that you'd like me to. Cover that I you don't see that I've mentioned anything like that. I'm more than happy to to. To get anyone's feedback.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
Mildred Salas Yip: I do?

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:11:06.000
Mildred Salas Yip: I, and I've mentioned this before. Um you have. You have 3 panels on the screen. I'm realizing that the left-hand panel is the driver panel. And then on the right side is where all the other stuff takes place. The issue I am having is that every time I set something on my driver's side. And then I go to my print. I think that I am. Overlapping and undoing what I did. In the driver's side.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay, and and. To be clear. You're talking about this. The lightroom print module right.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000
Mildred Salas Yip: Correct.

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay, all right. So I will definitely. Address, that when. Because that's right within what I want to talk about, anyway. So I will definitely. Talk about that for sure, and you're you're. Well, you're not overlapping. You're mostly right in terms of how it's laid out for sure. Um. I don't think you're overlapping settings, but you, you know there may be something that I can. Clarify for you so.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000
Mildred Salas Yip: Okay.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Anybody else have anything that they want to share. Or ask about again doesn't have to be specific about lightroom. Maybe anything. Maybe you're using another application. Um go for it. Anybody. There's got to be some questions out there, I'm sure.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:01.000
donaldboyd: Oh, Hi! Robert! Um. Yeah, it's don here. Um.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Hi.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:29.000
donaldboyd: Yeah, I have this similar question uh to the 1st one, too. Where. It. It looks on your on the lightroom panel. It looks like there's 3 places. Really to adjust. Settings, and that's what I'm kind of wondering, too. Sometimes you you. Use one. And and I I just get confused as to what the. What the best workflow to do and to stick with is.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay. Alright, alright, fair enough. Yeah. And as I look at it now, I'm looking at buttons that I never look at and ignore, because they are slightly redundant. So I will say, maybe there's a. Purpose, for lightroom. But yeah, I will definitely definitely address. Anybody else have anything that they want to add or. Ask about, or suggest, or.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:59.000
Jerry Stachowski: Robert, do you ever use um? The Epson print layout software.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Well, I've used it in the past. I've used that. And I've also used the of course, Canon's similar software Canon print. Canon, professional print and layout and absence as well. I've used them both. I find that they're doing. More or less the same things that lightroom is doing. But. Um. I'm not having to. For me if I can achieve the same thing in lightroom without going to another application. Then. I find it more streamlined, let's say, to stay in lightroom. I don't. I don't see that they're giving me anything that I can't achieve in lightroom already. And again the the and I'll talk about this in a moment. The the settings, the templates that you can save in lightroom are really powerful for me now.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um, if. Is there anything specific that you find in the Epson that you're not getting in lightroom? Or do you prefer that for some reason.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000
Jerry Stachowski: If I dive into the advanced black and white mode.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:11.000
Jerry Stachowski: Um. I've found that it's. Better using the Epson print layout because it lets me use my own image. There. To do the manipulation.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So you mean things like ah, toning the image.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000
Jerry Stachowski: Um. Yeah.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Like adding a sepia tint, or something like that.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:22.000
Jerry Stachowski: Uh-huh.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:15:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah. So you make you bring up a good point, because the Epson. Printer, driver by default. Doesn't. It lets you tone your image, but it doesn't let you see any preview or anything like that. And so in the Epson print layout. Yeah, you can get that. Again um. Like I've said many times in terms of tools. If someone is using a tool and they're happy with it, and they're getting the results that they want at the end of the day. That is the most important thing that we are getting. What we want. From our energy and our. The time that we're putting into it. Then that's great. I have no issues with that whatsoever.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I. If I want to apply any kind of split toning, I do it in lightroom. I use the color grading panel. And then I can actually see in the image in lightroom.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:09.000
Jerry Stachowski: Okay.

00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: What it's going to look like. So, for example. Let's say. If I let's say I go to this image here. Even though we're in black and white mode. Which means that we have no access to. Any of the color adjustments in Lightroom we still have access to the color grading. And in the color grading I can easily add any kind of toning that I want to. This whatsoever. All right. So that's a sepia or a warm tone into the mid-tones. But I can also add it into the highlights.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:16:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay, or I can add A, you know. Um. A blue tone or a cool tone into the highlights. Something like that. All right, so. This is generally how I go about adding some. Toning to an image. If I want to do a. You know anything you want to do here. So, for example, a cross. Toning or split toning. So I'm cooling off the shadows a little bit. And I'm adding some to the highlights.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Then I'm able to do that for me. I can see here exactly what the toning looks like. Sure you could probably see that similarly in the Epson layout, as well. But. I mean, I think I have a little more control here. And I can always save this out as a virtual copy. So that this image could be one where I'm toning it to print a certain way. And then my original is staying. Neutral or untoned. So that's generally the workflow that I use. Um, so yeah, hopefully, that. That's that's kind of how I go about doing it. Now, when you do this.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Toning in lightroom. In fact, even when I'm not toning in lightroom, I'm still always printing, using the color profile. So I'm not printing out. Without color management in lightroom. I always have the color management on. So if you print. If you print black and white from lightroom, I suggest you still maintain the color profile. Because you can do this kind of split toning thing, whereas if you don't do that. Then you're always going to export a black and white, and then you have to do, not export. You're always going to print a black and white, and you have to do some color toning afterwards, like you're doing in the Epson print layout or. Very coarsely in the Epson printer driver, which is, which is not great, so.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
Jerry Stachowski: Thank you.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah. Okay, so um.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.000
Howard Krieger: Robert, one quick question.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Sure. Absolutely. Yeah.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:18:20.000
Howard Krieger: Um. I just wanna make sure my. Workflow that I'm using. Once I go through lightroom and go through the print module. Once I hit print. Then it brings up the Epson. Preview and. In that preview. Should the. Picture that I saw within lightroom and worked on. Be identical, and look. When it previews in the Epson profile, you know. But uh, because that's what's happening is the Epson is. Popping up, and then it gives me that preview.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah. So I have to admit that I'm not sure. That I have seen what you're. What you're talking about. So if I. Um. Well, let's do this to keep this a little bit simpler. I'll go through a workflow, and then when we get to that stage. Just just mention it and. Because we'll get to the printer driver section, and then we'll see if what you see here on my screen is the same thing you're getting. Is that fair?

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000
Howard Krieger: Fair enough. Yeah.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay. And this way we'll just, and we'll keep this progression. And then I'll definitely be be sure to stop. Where you mentioned. Okay, so.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.000
Howard Krieger: Right.

00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Let me just share something. Here. Once again! All right. I want to share this graphic here for a minute and just explain what's going on here, because I think this will help you. Get a conceptual overview. What's going on? Okay. Now this applies to what I'm going to show you here is specific to resolution, but it also. I think, explains what's happening in general. When you make a print from lightroom. So we've got lightroom running on our computer here. It could be a Mac or a windows machine. Okay, the.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:20:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Program. The application lightroom is running on top of the operating system. Macro Windows. Then there's a printer driver, and the printer driver sits between. Lightroom, and the actual printer itself. The printer driver is the interpreter. If you will. That allows your computer, the operating system, to talk to the printer. This is why, whenever you install a printer, you have to install the printer, driver, and. Whenever you're having issues, or there's a new operating system, update. Canon or Epson will release new printer drivers, so that.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You have a printer driver that is compatible with the operating system. All right. So the printer driver. Sits in the operating system, and it's the interface, if you will, between lightroom. And the printer. So anytime you send a print. To, the. Anytime you make a print. The information has to go from lightroom. Through the printer, driver. The printer driver isn't a part of lightroom. As I said, it's a separate. Piece of software running on top of the operating system, and then the printer driver. Communicates with the printer.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:21:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Whether you have an Epson or a cannon, and. It sends the information over. All right. So that's important to understand. Number one. Because, for instance, when we come to lightroom. And I go to the print module. And I click on printer settings. Okay. This window pops up. Okay. This window is not.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A part of lightroom. It shows up in lightroom, and we see it in lightroom, but it is not part of lightroom. This window corresponds to the printer driver. And depending on which printer you have installed. You know whether it's Epson Canon, HP. Whatever. You're going to get a slightly different looking printer driver, or at least you're going to get different settings in. The printer driver. All right. So that's very important to understand. The printer driver again has independent settings from lightroom. Our goal is to make sure that they match up. Okay. Now back to the print module here.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:22:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: We have 2 panes, one on the left and one on the right. The one on the left here really is just for saving presets. So whenever you'd lay out a print in lightroom meaning. Nothing to do with the developing of the image, but when you lay it out on the piece of paper, meaning whatever margins you set, and whatever. Um, you know, options here for making the print larger, smaller, centered, etc. The actual layout on the piece of paper, how it's visually going to look. And also things like the printer settings themselves. So, in other words. What resolution we're going to print that, and I'll talk about that in a moment. Whether we set any kind of print sharpening. The profile that we use to print, whether we're even using a profile or not. All of these settings, all of the settings in here, just like in the develop module.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:23:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Can be saved as a preset. But here's an additional benefit. Remember I mentioned to you that when you click on print settings. This brings up the driver. However, the template browser in Lightroom, where you save your presets, also saves the settings that you set in. The driver. So, even though, as I said before, the driver isn't a part of lightroom. Lightroom will save the settings, which means that it simplifies your workflow quite a bit, because you don't have to go through that driver all the time to. I mean you can go through it to check that. Everything is set properly, but it saves those settings and. You don't have to do that all the time to make sure that you're going to get.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That you have the right setting set for your printer. The only time that changes. The only time you have to really check those presets is when. There's either, and this is less often. You know, lightroom updates. Does a major update. That's much less often much much rarer. What's more common is when the. Printer manufacturer releases a new driver. Because when they release a new driver they may change where things are in the driver, and when they change those things in the driver. Then your presets won't work.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:24:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Because they're in different places, and Epson has a habit of doing this where they'll move things around. What used to be in one place or somewhere else now, and so you have to go through and kind of. Reset them, and you can save them again. And I'll show you how to do that all right. So this left hand side here is just for saving presets, and this right hand side is for all the layout options. Now to Mildred's point, I think what you're talking about is these buttons down here. Alright, so there's a few buttons here, and there's a few buttons here. All right. By the way, there's 2 buttons here on a Mac, but on a windows machine there's only one. Windows only, has print settings. And the page setup is a part of the driver when it opens up. Here in lightroom. You get 2 buttons here. So typically.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000
Mildred Salas Yip: Oh!

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um. And I've as I've used the lightroom more and more, and I've learned exactly how things are working. I usually wait until I've set. Everything up in the lightroom print module, especially. The color management section here. I do that 1st before I go here, and there's a reason for that.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.000
Mildred Salas Yip: Okay.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:25:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay, so I do all of this first.st Now. All of these options up here are simply for. As I said, laying out your print. There's a couple cool things here. For example, if you need to print at a specific size, for whatever reason you need to make the print a specific size. I don't mean the paper, but the actual print. So, for example, if you need to print a something that's. 9 inches high by. 10 inches like that. Let's just say you needed to make a 9 by 10 print. I just set that arbitrarily. But if you needed to do that. You'll see that your image doesn't fit. Into this box, and.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:26:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: One way to change, that is, if you go up here to image settings, you can click on zoom to fill. And it will now zoom the image in meaning. It'll crop the image to fit this box. And you can actually change what actually shows up. When you print. And this is. Course, non-destructive is not changing your file in any way. This is just in the print module. So just pointing this out for 2 reasons. One is that this capability exists. But the other reason is because you you may have this turned on without realizing it, and if you do have it turned on. Then you're always going to have this problem where, no matter how you resize the cell, because that's the area that you. That you're. The box, and with your the box within. Where your image is going to lay on the piece of paper.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You're always going to get this problem where it's changing the aspect ratio. So you want to uncheck this zoom to fill. So now it never changes the aspect, ratio. So those 2 little things are are just something to be aware of. Only use the zoom. Only have the zoom to fill checked. I'm sorry. Only have the zoom to fill checked.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:30.000
Howard Krieger: If you're.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: When you actually do want to. Change the aspect ratio of the image, otherwise leave that unchecked. I'm sorry. Go ahead, sure.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:59.000
Howard Krieger: Quick question, Robert. If you want to go. To the cell size of 17 by 22. Which is what I have available for the larger printer. It only goes up to what? 10 on the height. Or can you go beyond that in terms of the. You know selection.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Well, it so it depends on the paper. So right now let's go into. Let's go into page setup. When I mentioned before about doing this first.st Setting your color management options before going into the printer settings. I'm specifically talking about print settings. But the page setup. So these 2 buttons here the page setup is. Just to set the size of the paper that you're going to print on, that's all it really does. So you see that all I have here is options for selecting the print.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000
Howard Krieger: Gotcha.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:28:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And the paper size. It's only when you click on print settings that now we go into the driver to change settings. So. Let's click on page setup, and if I come in here and I select um. 17 by 22, which is. Where is that? Here we go. 17. By 22. All right, and this that'll give us a 17 by 22 size paper. I set the orientation landscape hit. Ok. Now you see that we have a piece of paper that is 22 inches wide by 17 high. And then again make sure the zoom to fill is unchecked. That's most usually always where I have it. We can set our margins. Now these margins are on top of. The mandatory margins that the printer enforces. So, for example, if I 0 out these margins in lightroom.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Meaning that I go as small as they can be. You'll notice that even even though I go as small as I can, I still have a. 0 point 1 2 on the left, 0 point 2 0 on the right, 0 point 1 3 on top and point 1 3 in the bottom. And that is enforced by by the printer. So that's where you see this little gray area around.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000
Mildred Salas Yip: Okay.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:29:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If I make my margins as small as possible, and then. The cell size defines how big your image is going to be on the piece of paper. I come down here to image size, and I expand this out as far as it'll go. Okay, that's as big of a. Print that's as big of a print as you're going to be able to make. In other words, that's as big. Of a image that you're going to get on this piece of paper. It's going to be not 17 by 22, but. 16.7 by 21.6 8. Depending on your aspect, ratio.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000
Howard Krieger: Got it. Thank you.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay, does that.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.000
Mildred Salas Yip: Okay.

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Answer what you were asking about, or.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000
Howard Krieger: It does. It does. Thank you.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay. Yeah. Now I I almost never will print like this, because. Number one, when you actually get the physical print. It doesn't look that great when you've got this little quarter inch border on both sides.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.000
Mildred Salas Yip: Mhm.

00:29:22.000 --> 00:30:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And number 2. It makes it harder to handle it right, because now I have to be very careful. That I'm always wearing gloves, or that. Um. I don't get my fingerprints on the image itself. Number 3. It makes it less flexible for use. Because if I want to mat this now, I have tiny, tiny border here that I can matte with. And that's assuming that you place your mat over the image. I sometimes like to place my mat outside the image, and I'm showing a quarter inch of paper all around, and if I want to do that, then I can't do it with this, because I don't have enough space. So I will typically set a border all around of at least an inch. So for that I will go into the margins here. And I'll just type one. One like that. And now I've got.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A margin of one inch all around. My cell size is as far as it'll go. Okay. And now I got some room and some space, and it looks better and. For me on this type. On this size paper. I would even go bigger than that. I usually go like one and a half. Like that. Okay? And now I've got. Room to sign my name. I've got room to make little notes down here if I want to, in terms of the paper that I use? Or what have you notes that. If you use a light pencil and you, matte this you're never going to see, anyway. And then I also have the flexibility of using a matte that shows some of the paper or not. So you have that flexibility. Okay, so that's the the margins here. And. The cell size. These lines that you see on the print.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:31:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That is controlled. By this guides area here, so I can turn that off, and I don't see any guides. I turn it on. And I see the guides. I usually have these guides on all the time, because it shows you. You know where your margins are, and it gives you a sense of. What's happening, and with margins and borders and things like that. Okay. The other options here are for. You know, adding things on top of the print. So, for example, if I wanted to put a logo. Something like this. I wouldn't use this on this print here, but I do some customer type stuff where they do want a logo.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:32:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And where's the rotation? Here, there we go. I can rotate this. And this is just a graphic that you import, and I could. Put this down here if I want it like that. All right. So you're able to place graphics on top of your image. Only one at a time, only one at a time. But this could be anything right. So this graphic could be anything you make in Photoshop. Or what have you. And you use the identity plate for that. If I click here. You see that I have other identity plates here so you can save them. I have one called.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: R rjr, and that's my logo. I don't quite see that now. So maybe I don't have that anymore. Let me see, I haven't used these in quite a while, because I don't. Put the Logos that much anymore. There's another logo for my for creative path. Alright. So something like that. If that's something that you wanted to use. Whatever I've done stuff where I was doing a portfolio, and I wanted to have my logo at the bottom, but I had it in the center like this. Something like that, and then when it prints, I'm going to turn off the guides, it would look like that. Okay, so this is kind of cool. You can use that to again. Put stuff on your image. If you want to do that. Now I'm going to come down here to the print job section, and this is where I said that you should do this before you go into the printer settings.

00:32:54.000 --> 00:33:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I'll explain why in a minute. So in this print shop section. You have the printer. Resolution. Ah option! Print resolution option, which is an interpolation option. I'm going to uncheck that for now. So we're not interpolating, interpolating. Essentially is a fancy word for either upscaling or downscaling. It means that we either. Making our image bigger than it is natively. In other words, we're making our file a little bit bigger, or we are making our file a little bit smaller than what the native. Information is in the file, and I'll talk about why you may want to do that. We have an option for. Adding a little bit of sharpening to the print when we send it to the printer.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:34:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Right? So that's called typically called output sharpening or print sharpening. I'm going to uncheck that for a moment we have an option here. To enable sixteen-bit output. I'm not really sure why. You would want not to turn this on, but. I always have this on. If you've got raw files, your raw files are going to be. Greater than 8 bits, and so. Checking. This means that you'll send all the information that the file contains to the printer. And then we've got the color management section here. Okay, and.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: By the way, if you don't see these, just make sure you expand them. So you see. In the column management section. We've got. A place to select the profile. And this is the profile. That you're going to tell Lightroom to use when it sends. The information to the printer. If you click here. You'll see a dropdown with profiles, and if I set this to managed by printer. We are now taking away the responsibility of lightroom to manage the colors, and we're telling the printer.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:35:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To be responsible for the colors. This is a you can call it a non-managed workflow, because now you're asking the printer to take a very good guess in terms of what the appropriate color should be. It could be that many times it'll guess right, and you'll get great results. But you can't be sure about that. And it's not going to lead to consistency, because when you don't get the right. Results when you don't get accurate color. Well, now, you're not sure what's happening. Is it the printer? Is it something that you did in lightroom? Is it your monitor. And so here. You can specify a specific profile for your paper. Now let's assume this could be with. This is going to be the same with any manufacturer, or any any.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Reputable manufacturer. They will provide profiles. You can create your own, of course. But if I come over to. Canson, and let's say I'm printing on a pro 1,000. I have the printer inputed here, Canon, I put my model. And then you'll get this list here of all of their papers with the. Profiles that you can download. So, for example, if I'm printing onto. Platoine, or, let's say, rag photographic. Right here. Click this box. And then I click on download and it'll download the profile.

00:35:52.000 --> 00:36:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That's a file that you then have to install on your computer. And then you have to install it in lightroom. You have to do 2 steps. This over here is just a little chart that tells you what media type you should use. For that paper in your printer. And I'll explain that as well, because that can also be a little bit confusing. When you download the file. By the way down here, there's some instructions. Some videos that you can watch that. Show you exactly how to install the profile. It's pretty simple. There's a folder on Mac OS that's called color Sync. And inside there's profiles. You just put it in there on windows. It's actually easy on windows. You just right click on the file and say, install profile.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:37:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And installs it for you. But, I said, there's a two-step process. When you install a profile. On your operating system. Then, if lightroom is open. You have to quit lightroom and reopen it, because when you quit it and reopen it, it will read that profile folder where you put the profiles, and it will say, Ah, there's some new profiles installed. And then you have to, I'm going to say, install into lightroom. It really just means tell Lightroom to. Access it. And the way you do that is. Here, where it says, managed by printer. If I click at the bottom where it says other.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Then this shows you all the profiles that are installed on your operating system. But there's a little checkbox next to it, and if the checkbox is unchecked. You're not going to see it in lightroom. So if you notice that if I scroll down. Some of my profiles have a checks and some some of them don't, and that's because I don't want to see them all. So this is a little. Feature, if you will, of lightroom that allows you to just show in lightroom the profiles you want to have access to and hide all the others, because there's a lot of profiles that I don't want to see. Maybe I'm not using them anymore. And I don't want this humongous menu. It's confusing. So if you just install the profile, and the profile is. You know. Aqua. Rel. 310 for the.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:38:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Epson, p. 800. Then you check that box, and now you will see it. In this dropdown. In fact, it's the one that was just selected. Okay? So that's how you are able to get these profiles here. And this is a again, a subset. Of the total profiles installed on your computer. Now the reason why you want to select this profile first, st before you open up the print settings is as follows. If you leave this unmanaged by. Printer. Okay? Then, when you click on print settings here to open up the print driver. The print driver will. Think that um.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:39:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You're asking it to manage the colors, and then you may go back to lightroom and then select the profile, and the settings here may not always sync up. The most important setting that you want to look at in on Mac OS. And this is not the case on windows, but on Mac OS is here in printer options. Okay. You see where it says, color matching. All right if I click here on the little eye. You see here? It says, Canon, color matching. And that's because the reason this, says Canon color matching is because I turned off. The profile in lightroom, and I said, managed by printer, and that's exactly what's going to happen here. Canon color matching is going to.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Control the color. If it was Epson, it would say. Epson. Color matching is something similar. What you want here is for it to say color sync, because color sync is. Apple's own color management system, which will then let lightroom control the system. So, for example, if I click on cancel here. Click on cancel. I'll come back here to Lightroom. I'll select now a profile. So I'll select anyone here. Are shady. 8. It doesn't really matter. As long as you have a profile selected for the purpose of what I'm showing you now. When you come back to print settings which opens up the print driver. And I come to printer options.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:40:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I click on color, matching. Now you see, it says color sync, and that's what you always want to see. You want to make sure that this says color sync. Now, it should almost always say that. But you know software isn't perfect, and once in a while you may be having an issue. So, for example. If I'm making a print, and I'm not getting accurate colors. The 1st thing I'll do is one of the things I'll do is I'll check here to make sure that this is checked color sync. This means that the driver isn't doing any color management. It's letting lightroom do the color management for you. Okay. Now, the other thing that you want to set here this is just to check. You don't have to set this. This should be checked automatically. But you see here, I went back to see how it's set back here to color matching.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:41:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That's a very weird thing that happens. So this should say, color sync. And so if I come back over here. And I'm going to click on that again. Okay. Now, it says, color sync. So I hit Ok, and that's what you want. Yeah, maybe I hit cancel before. And it changed. So that's something you have to just keep your eye on. But the thing you you have to set here is also in the quality and media section. All we're doing in the quality in media is 2 things. 2 things. We are. Well, 3 things really it. They concern the paper, right, the paper feeding and the type of paper, and then. The quality of the printer. So the paper here. The media type.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This information here media type. What type of paper you should be using. Is what you're going to get from. The. Canson website. So if you're printing on right Photographique or arch, or whatever it is, this will tell you here what media type to use. By the way, the reason there are 3 columns is because one is for. I guess it's Europe. One is for the Us. And one is for Australia. Don't know why they're different, but. Wherever you are, use the one that you need. But I'm going to go with us here. I'm assuming US. Means North America.

00:41:51.000 --> 00:42:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So Raich Photographique. Highest density. Fine art paper. That's the media type that you need to enter. Here, and you see that I have highest density, fine art, paper. What this does is that this. Number one will tell which the tell the printer which. Color cartridge to use in terms of the blacks, whether it will use the photo black or the matte black ink. And because I'm sending it to. Highest density, fine art, media. That means it'll use the matte, black ink.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:43:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If you don't set this properly, it may use the photo blacking to print onto a matte paper, in which case you're not going to get the best results. This sets your paper source manual or top, and usually for most printers. When you're using a matte paper, you have to feed from the back. And then you set your print quality, and the print quality is. The how many dots the printer is going to use to make the print. So this essentially. It's just telling the printer what quality should I print with? And. Almost always I set this to highest. There's no reason why not to set it to highest. If you're trying to get the best quality out of your printer. Now I'm going to hit cancel here, and I'm going to change this from Canon to Epson. When we go to Epson and I click on printer settings, it's going to be slightly different.

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Slightly different, but the concepts are the same. We still have the paper source. Media type. And remember that. On the Canson website. This is for Canon. But if I change this to Epsom. And select. P. 800. P. 800 is up here somewhere. Now we get a different chart and. Let's say I'm printing onto rag photographiq.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Now the paper type that I should set on my Epson printer is velvet fine art.

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.000
Mildred Salas Yip: Okay.

00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: All right. So I come back over here. And I'm going to change the media type now to. Fine art, paper, velvet. Fine art. Now you'll notice that it's grayed out. Okay. Can anybody tell me why it's grayed out.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:04.000
Mildred Salas Yip: You didn't load it. You didn't load it to your. You didn't change it in the color management.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: No, this is. This is just a paper type, nothing to do with color management. So why can't I select. Velvet, fine art here.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.000
Mildred Salas Yip: I don't know.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.000
Howard Krieger: You didn't download it.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: No.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.000
Mark Ryan: Cheap eater.

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Right. So the reason is because Epson is very specific or very finicky, or very. Uh uh. Strict about what type of paper you can feed in the printer, and I have it set to sheet feeder, which is the top. You cannot feed mad paper. Into the sheet feeder. You can. Let me rephrase that. You can certainly put mad paper in the sheet feeder. But you're not going to be able to select the right media type. I have to change the paper source to. Front. Fine art! Which means that I'm telling Epson I am going to feed it from the front, and when I do that, then. The Fine Art Paper.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Type is available. So now I can set this to velvet. Fine art. Okay, so it just. Won't let you select. The paper unless you're using the appropriate feeder type.

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:12.000
Mildred Salas Yip: So how would you know that? Only because it's grayed out.

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um. Yes. Yeah. Well, you would have to know that. Epson printers. The Fine art papers have to be fed from the front. Non-fine art papers like, for example. Fine art paper here. Is a matte paper. Okay? So these papers here in the fine art section are also matte papers. So they're the same kind of paper. But if I select a matte paper here. One of these ultra premium presentation, mat. I can select the sheet feeder, and I can print from the sheet feeder. It's only when I select.

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Only when I want to use one of the fine art type papers. That I must change the paper source to front fine art. And you just you just.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.000
Mildred Salas Yip: And then.

00:45:55.000 --> 00:46:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You just know that you just memorize it, or you just run into the problem enough on your Epson printer that you just know. That's the case.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.000
Mildred Salas Yip: That's my problem. Yeah.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay. It's probably in the manual. It probably says it in the manual, but you just.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:07.000
Mildred Salas Yip: But it's so difficult.

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You said, gee! How come? I can't get this, and once you figure it out, it's so frustrating that you'll never forget again, or at least you hope you won't, or put a little yellow sticky on your printer. That says. You have to change the paper source. Okay? So.

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.000
Howard Krieger: Robert, just to clarify.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Sure.

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:25.000
Howard Krieger: If it's an Epson printer. But you're using Canson paper. And you know.

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Does. Yeah, no, right? I totally get your question. It doesn't. It doesn't matter. The paper manufacturer what matters is what the paper manufacturer, what type of paper the paper manufacturer wants you to use. So notice here that on the Canson website. Right. If I want to use certain papers, it's telling me I need to set the Epson to velvet. Fine art. Once I have to set it to vote fine art, then I have to. Adhere to Epson's requirement to use the front. Feed, make sense.

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:55.000
Howard Krieger: It does. Thank you.

00:46:54.000 --> 00:47:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay, yeah, yeah. And I know how this can be. Um frustrating. One little thing I will mention here just as an aside, is, you'll notice, if I so notice here. These are all media types. So you have to use these media types on the Epson printer. If I go back a minute to Canon. And I'm going to select pro 1,000. Where is it? Here, and this is with other canon printers as well.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:48:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But you'll notice that I haven't. There's an option here, it says for any of these papers. It says. Highest density, fine art, paper. But it also says, Am. One X file included. All right, and this is very cool. What this is is that this is a file, a special file that. Cansign will give you, and Canon. Allows you to. Use this file to configure Canson's papers inside the canon driver. All right. What does that mean? It means that when you load this file in and you can do that through software that canon gives you. I'm trying to make sure that I leave that S in when I need to, and take it out when I don't need it. Okay.

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: When you load this file in on a canon printer. That Canson gives you. What that means is that. When I select my canon, printer. And I go to quality and media. Okay. Instead of guessing for the media type here, you will actually see Canson right in here. And it'll say, Canson. Rag, photographique, Platine, Baraida. Whatever. That is, you would think intuitively how it should work. You should be able to choose. The actual paper that you're using here.

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The reason why Canon lets you do that. Well, I'll ask, why do you think Canon lets you do that? But Epson doesn't.

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:45.000
Howard Krieger: Canon cares about its customers.

00:48:46.000 --> 00:49:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Well, yes, that's a very. I would say, yes, you're absolutely right. And the other reason is because. Epson doesn't want to make it easy for you to use. Other people's papers, so they want you to use their own. If Epson allowed you to put Canson's papers here, anybody else's. It just makes it easier for you to use a non-epsom paper, and Epson and Epson is. You know Epson makes. Uh. Makes money on their papers.

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: By the way, I think I mentioned this before, but all of. I'll ask again, who do you think makes Epson's fine art papers.

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:26.000
Mark Ryan: Hands, on.

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Correct. Okay, so. Back to the Epson. Here. I'll click on print settings. What we want to set here is. The paper source. We talked about this already. So I want front fine art. Now I can choose velvet. Fine art. Okay, so that's our media type. This is again critical, so that the printer uses the correct black ink. And it also makes some other adjustments. It puts a little more, a little less ink, depending on the paper, and. How thick it is, etc.

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Then print mode. Okay, you can leave this there. Color mode. You want this to be off. Right this off. Here. Is really really critical. This should be off. What does this mean? Remember, we are in the Epson printer, driver. Now. And we don't want the printer driver. Come back here again. We don't want anything over here managing color. We want lightroom to manage color. And so, because we don't want anything over here to manage color. We want to make sure that there's no color management going on here, and there's no color management going on here.

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And because we're in the printer driver here, we want to tell the printer driver off. No color management. I think, Mildred, you mentioned if I set this to Epson Standard. Okay, meaning that now the driver is doing color management and. We have a profile set here in lightroom. We are doing double color management, and you're never.

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:54.000
Mildred Salas Yip: Right.

00:50:52.000 --> 00:51:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You're never going to get accurate color. Because it's like having 2 captains of a ship. Right? You're never going to go anywhere you want to go, because. Well, you can figure that out.

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:04.000
Mildred Salas Yip: Yes.

00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: All right. So you want to turn off color management everywhere if you're using it in lightroom. So here, I want to set this color mode. Off. And then here output resolution. This is very similar to Canon, except Canon called it. Quality, setting. Here Epson actually. Makes it a little bit more specific. Output resolution. And notice that this is a Dpi, not a PPI. That means that this is dots. So that's how many little ink dots the printer is going to use to make your print, and the more the better.

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The more you use the better print quality you're going to get. Okay. Um. So those are the critical settings here. Right.

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:58.000
Mildred Salas Yip: So, Robert, go back to the print mode on that on that menu where it says. Epson. Precise. What is it? Precision? What. I can't even see it.

00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Output resolution.

00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:02.000
Mildred Salas Yip: No, no, no print mode the print mode just where you were at absent.

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Oh, right? Right? Yeah. The other one is right. So the other one is, if you want to. This is also not. Going to be good, because this means well. 1st of all, this is for printing in black and white. So if you set this to advanced black and white, it's going to. Printed black and white image and. You're still double profiling. So you have a mess, all right. So this print mode should also always be set to Eps and precision.it should just say color versus black and white, but.

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:23.000
Mildred Salas Yip: Okay.

00:52:28.000 --> 00:53:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Because the other option here is to print in. Advanced black and white mode. So Epson precision dot, if you're printing a color image, you don't want to choose black and white. Okay. And then here no column management off. Now, once you have this set properly, I'm going to click on. Ok. I'm going to click on, save here. Notice that it says, Save not print. Now we save these settings. Okay. Let me just finish this over here, and then. We can actually save this as a template. So over here we got our column management set.

00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The only other thing that I want to share about here that I, unchecked before is. Print sharpening. I usually have this on. And if we click on print, sharpening lightroom gives you an option of the amount of print sharpening, you don't get a chance to preview it. But you'll see after a while that. Low. You can't really tell any difference. High is a little bit aggressive, so I've printed at all 3 of these with the same print. And, generally speaking, the consensus is that standard gives you something where you're getting a little bit of extra sharpening, but it's nothing that. Is going to be a negative impact. And then you get to select the media type. Here, matte or glossy. And the reason is because if it's a matte paper. Lightroom will apply a tiny bit more sharpening because matte paper is again, by the nature of the matte and the cotton and the softer surface.

00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A little bit more sharpening will help. Glossy paper. You don't need as much sharpening so it'll adjust. Okay, based on that. But this print sharpening algorithm also. Works in conjunction with the print resolution setting. If you turn this on. Now, why would you want to turn this on? Well, that's that gets to my main graphic here. And here's what I want to explain. All printers. Epson, or Canon.

00:54:27.000 --> 00:55:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Have what's called a native printer. Resolution. And that means that it doesn't matter what file you send to these printers. Something needs to interpolate that image, upscale it, or downscale it so that it is fed to the printer or the printer receives it. At either 360 PPI in the Epson, or 300 PPI in the canon. That has to do with the hardware of the printer. It also has to do with the fact that the printer isn't. Going to print pixels is printing dots. And it has to convert the pixels into dots. Okay, you'll notice, by the way, for those of you who like math. That the Epson printer.

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: When you go into the output resolution, the options are 1440, and 2880. 2880 dots. But that's a. Perfect multiplication of 360. Because if you multiply 360 by 8, you get 2880. So that's how it's converting the pixels to dots. If you print that 2880, you're getting. 8 dots of ink per pixel. Same thing with the canon. The canon doesn't actually show you the Dpi, but it's 600, 1,200, which are multiples of 300. Okay? So. Forget that little math thing. There. The printer needs to receive. 360, or 300.

00:55:44.000 --> 00:56:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: When you send the print from lightroom. There are 2 ways to get that, interpolated. To this number, either lightroom, does it? Or the printer driver does it. Either one is going to interpolate. So that the printer can get what it needs to make the print. And it just so happens that the interpolation method is much, far superior in lightroom than it is in the printer driver. And that's why we want to turn this on. If you leave this off. All right. If you leave this print resolution off. What that means is that now the.

00:56:17.000 --> 00:57:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Driver is going to do the interpolation. And the driver doesn't do a great job. It's not print. It's not. It's just that the mathematics is not going to be as good. The algorithm isn't as good as the one that is in lightroom, because the one in lightroom is designed and developed by adobe. And so they've put effort into doing this. Whereas remember the one here in the printer driver. Isn't necessarily for photographers. It's a printer driver to print any kind of image you could be in an office situation. You could be in a business whatever. It just needs to interpolate it. But it's not necessarily going to give you the best quality. So because it has to be interpolated, no matter what. It's better to do it here, and this is why. If we're printing to an Epson, I suggest you check this, and you set this to Epson's native resolution, and Epson's native resolution is.

00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: 360. Now that file will be interpolated in lightroom. Which is a better interpolation. The driver won't do anything, and will get a nice clean file. Going into our printer. So you set this to 360. Like that. And now the print is going to be interpolated to that. PPI setting, and then it goes. It flows through the printer pipeline, without any more. Manipulation.

00:57:36.000 --> 00:58:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Now that I turned this on. The other thing I wanted to mention is that when I uncheck this. Okay, and I come up here and turn on photo guides or show guides. I'm sorry. Show guides. This will show you the native resolution. Of your image at the size that you're printing. So remember. Our native size. The PPI that we have available to print is completely dependent on the size of the print we want to make. This number here 273 PPI. Means that. For this file that I have for this image. And the resolution in the image. The number of pixels in this image, based on my camera. Printing at this size of 17 by 22. The best I can do is 273 PPI, which means that.

00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'm only going to be able to get 273 pixels per inch. Watch if I come over here to the cell size, and I adjust the cell size. That number is going to go up. Because we have. We're printing a smaller image. And because we're making a smaller image. We have more pixels to distribute. In the piece of paper right? If we make a little 8 and a half by 11, we have lots of pixels. If we make a huge print, we're going to have a lower count of pixels, because. Again, it's reading from the original size.

00:58:50.000 --> 00:59:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The image, original image, size. To put it a different way. Photographers that want to make huge prints. Will usually try to buy a camera that has more megapixels. Because if you buy more megapixels, this number will go up by dint of the fact that your sensor captures more so if you got a phase, one with an 80 megapixel back. This number here for this size may be something like 400 pixels per inch. Okay. Now, this 273 here means that that's what our current size is. And if I send this print without interpolating well, the software. The printer driver is going to have to convert this from 273 to 360. So we want to do it here in lightroom. I turn this on, and now it's going to interpolate it, and notice that when I checked this box. That disappeared because we're no longer printing at the native resolution. 273.

00:59:43.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: We're now printing at. This setting that lightroom is going to use to interpolate the image. If I were printing onto a canon. I would set this to 300. Because for the canon we need 300 PPI. All right. So you just have to remember. If you have one printer, it's Epson, 360 canon. It's 300. Now that everything is exactly set. Before I make a print I will come over here. And in the template browser I will click on this, plus sign.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And this allows me to now save a preset with everything that we just set in the print module, including the printer driver. And because this saves everything. Um. You want to give it a name that captures. The variables. By that I mean a what printer is this? For? If you only got one printer. Then you don't have to put the printer name in. But if you've got 2 printers like I do, Epson and Canon, I want to put the printer because the printer driver is specific. Now. Right, so I don't remember what I did last with Epson or Canon, but let's say it was Epson. I'll put Epson. I want to put the paper size, because that is definitely something that is part of this layout. 17, by 22. And I want to put the paper.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Because we have a profile set in this template, and that profile is specific for a paper. So I want to save that as my. Part of my preset as well, so I would call this um. R. Shady. And then I'll click on, create. And that saved a preset here. Okay. Now, the reason why this is really really nice is because, for example. I'm going to use a very drastic example. I regularly print note cards. When I print note cards for a customer.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Or a client. I just come over here and select this template. And I click on that. That's my note card. Now it isn't exactly right. Because you notice that if I fold this card over. The image is going to be upside down. So what I typically do before I print. For this customer is, I'll go to the library module and use these little. Arrows here to turn it upside down. Then I take it back into the print module.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And that's how I print my note card and notice that this has all my margins perfectly set. The fold line is going to be here. So I'm also going to have a little margin between the top of the image and the fold. I got their logo and. Everything here is set print, resolution, print, sharpening, and I even got the profile. Moab artist cards, and if I clicked on, if I click on print settings. Okay? And I click on printer options. Everything is set here properly. I've got color mode off. I've got the high resolution that I want always.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:03:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I got the paper setting. I got everything set properly. All right. I'm going to click on. Ok. I hit cancel. Now let's let's say that. Oh, I'm done with this. I want to come back and make a print 1722 that we just set up. Well, of course I'm going to turn this back the right way. Now I'll click on this. 1722 r. Shade 8 that we made a minute ago. And now we're back to this layout, and guess what if I go into the printer. Driver, once again. My settings are set properly for this layout for this paper, for this print, notice that before the media type was ultra premium presentation, or something like that. Now it's set to velvet. Fine art.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Now to the last question. Page setup here sets up. The paper size. Print settings, lets you determine all the appropriate. Options for the printer, driver. Print. Basically just sends the print. So I just sent the print to my printer. So the cool thing about the print button here is that you just click it, and you don't even have to deal with a dialogue. The difference between the print and the printer here.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay, this is the way to think about it. This is where you set it up. This is where you execute. So once I set it up over here, if I want to just send one print, and I don't want to deal with a dialogue. I click on print. But when I print note cards I want to make 10 of those note cards. Not just one. And if I click on print here, I have to click on this button 10 times. Okay, so I click on printer, and this allows me. Basically to just, it's a repetition of this. Button here, but I can. Usually I come over here and I just make I just click on 10 here. And then I click print, and it'll make it'll make 10 prints, and I have to make sure that I have. Note cards in the sheet feeder so that it feeds them all in.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay. So I very rarely. To explain it a different way. Very rarely do I use this printer button here, because. 99% of the times. I'm just making one print at a time. This is when you want to make multiples. I usually just use the 1st 3. Page setup determines the size of the paper. Print settings allows me to. Interact with the printer driver and get the right settings for what I'm doing. And then print is just a button that sends. I don't, you know, as I showed you before, you don't have to.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To go to another dialog. You just hit click on print. Did that answer your question, Howard? If Howard is still with us.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:19.000
Howard Krieger: It did, Robert. Thank you. I now know what I was doing incorrectly.

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Howard Krieger: So I appreciate it.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You want? Do you want to share what that was or no?

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:36.000
Howard Krieger: Well, it it was. I was confounding the system by. Letting, setting, some, many. Things in lightroom, but then turning it back over to the printer.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Is it? Yeah.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Howard Krieger: Or final, you know guidance and.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay, yeah, that's you know. Thank you for the for sharing that. And.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000
Howard Krieger: Yeah.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:06:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That makes perfect sense. I've probably done it, and it. You have to wrap your head around it. But I think the the key thing here that I want to make sure you guys understand is one is. This button here. Print settings right. There are ways that I think. Adobe could improve this a little bit. Maybe call this printer, driver. So it's a little clearer that you're not now inside.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.000
Mildred Salas Yip: Mhm.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Lightroom any longer. A little hint of that. A little hint of that is, you notice if I click on print settings. The color here is a little bit different, although the other windows in lightroom are also light like this. But. You just. You just have to learn, I suppose. But this is the printer, driver. So, for example, if I. Let's go to this application. Here, let's go to my browser. Okay, if I go to my browser, I'm in my browser now. If I go to print. Okay, well, that wasn't a good example, because this has its own.

01:06:43.000 --> 01:07:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Printer driver. But let's say I go. Let's try this. I don't know if this is going to work or not, but I'm just trying to show you what happens if I. Um. There's no printer as well, so. My point was that. If you print out of another application, maybe something simple, like. Pete a preview or something like that. When you try to print, you're going to get this similar window, which also tells you that it's the printer driver, not part of the actual software. Again, software will. Some software will actually create their own system. But lightroom, doesn't. It? Just lets you access the printer driver.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: One more thing I want to show you which this happens, or comes up all the time. Constantly get questions about this. And if I go into system settings. And this is a Mac thing, and I go into. Print and Scanners. And I go to Epson here. And I have to cancel this because my printer is actually off. So I'm not printing. Um. Uh! Let's go!

01:07:48.000 --> 01:08:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay. So here, this is really important. This is something that comes up all the time. One of the common questions that I get is when I go into my printer driver. I don't see all the options.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
Mildred Salas Yip: Mhm.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Print. So options for the media type and all that. If you ever get that, it's very common. When you install a printer. That this down here. Will say something other than driver version 3.2 6, or whatever the number is. It'll say essentially, it'll say something like secure air print. And you want to avoid that, because what that means. Is that? Okay, let me see. Explain this. You don't have to have the driver from Epson to use an Epson printer on your computer. Mac OS apple actually includes very basic drivers for all the printers out there.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:09:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So when you, when you add a printer to your system. Sometimes it will not. Use the Epson printer driver. It'll just assign the basic apple driver. And that apple driver typically is called. Uh secure air secure print something like that. That means you're not going to see all of the various options. And that'll drive you crazy because you won't be able to change the quality media type. You won't be able to turn color management off. So I usually when people, when I get questions about this, the 1st thing I ask them is, Show me this window. And if this says, secure air print what you need to do if it does that, what you need, if it shows that what you need to do is. You need to select your.

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Printer. This is going to vary, and I'm on a Mac OS. Sequoia. But if you're on Sonoma, or something older, it may be slightly different in the past. There was actually like a little minus button that you click here to remove a printer. Now you actually have to click on it. And then you can see. Remove printer. You have to remove the printer. Okay, you don't have to disconnect it, or anything from your system, from your computer. Just remove it. And then when you remove it, then you click on, add again, and when you click on, add. It'll show you printers that are connected. And then you want to make sure when you add it back on that. It's it shows driver version 3.2 6, which is.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:10:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In this case Epson's latest driver, and then you'll see the entire Epson driver with all the options that you need. To. To do proper. Proper. Printing. Okay.

01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000
Mildred Salas Yip: Okay. Awesome.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Again. That's only if you don't see the option. So if you come over here to print settings. And you have Epson selected, and you don't see printer options here. You don't see any of these windows. It just says something very basic. Chances are for some reason it doesn't have the right driver, because this is part of the driver right? This is part of. This over here. The printer, driver. All right, and apple. Try to. It tries to be nice by providing us with very basic drivers, and that works fine in an office where you're making, you know. Printing spreadsheets, but not going to work when you're printing photographs.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000
Mildred Salas Yip: Okay.

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Any questions on any of that at all. Anything that I missed, or um. Anybody want to add something that. Did I get it? Get it?

01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Virginia Kolstad: Yeah, Robert, this is Virginia. This is Virginia. I don't have a print settings button on the left side of my screen.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Was that clear for everyone. Yes, Virginia. Are you on Mac? Or windows.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000
Virginia Kolstad: Windows.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah. So I mentioned, that's perfectly great. Great question. Yeah. I mentioned that at the beginning. But great question.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
Virginia Kolstad: Oh, okay.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: One of the very few differences between Mac and windows and lightroom is that in Lightroom. And sorry on windows. You only have print settings, I believe, right.

01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:23.000
Virginia Kolstad: Just just page setup.

01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, page setup. So when you click on page. So here. On the on the Mac. It's broken this up into 2 windows. So if I click on page setup. You see, I only have options for page setup. And if I click on print settings. I don't have options for page setup on windows. You have page setup and print settings in the same dialog, that's all.

01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:45.000
Virginia Kolstad: Okay. Gotcha. Okay.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That's all it is. Yeah. So that's all. Um.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
donaldboyd: Robert, I got a question.

01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Sure.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:12:30.000
donaldboyd: I had the same sort of the same issue. You've just been talking about printing on Cardstock this week. And I think you've answered. The question, and it's um. I was using Red River, Cardstock. Prefolded cardstock, and I also used a red, a template that's on the Red Red River site. But I was having an issue where I was trying to put in the profile. For the paper. But I think the template. Was keep kept keeping it in in um, in managed by printer. And I couldn't change it, and I was getting weird colors.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:55.000
donaldboyd: On it, and. Now I I think that probably is why, and even right now, if I go. I lost my mic. Um! I took my finger off the space bar. Um! It's still on.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, yeah, I was about to say what happened.

01:12:55.000 --> 01:13:00.000
donaldboyd: Uh managed by printer, even though I have the Icc profile selected.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, so. Let me show you something here. This may help you, and I'm glad you brought this up because I did forget one little thing. So notice that I have I created this, this. Preset. Okay? Lightroom calls them templates. They're essentially presets. But let's go with template for now, because. We use the language that lightroom uses that keeps things straightforward. So I got this. Template. Okay, every time I every time I click on this template. It's going to set these things a certain way. So if I come over here and I change this to. Managed by printer, and I click on this template again. It sets it back to this profile.

01:13:39.000 --> 01:14:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So what I wanted to show, which I forgot before is how to update a template. Let's say you have a template. That you got from Red River or or your own right, and you decide that you want to update it. For some reason. Let's say that. In this case I want to, you know, I want to change the print sharpening to. Matte, instead of glossy. And I want to use this template. But I want to update it with this little change that I made so that it doesn't revert back to the original template. You want to right? Click. On the template itself. Or control click, if you don't have a mouse button.

01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Right click, and you'll see here that one of the options is update with current settings. And if I select that now, it updates that template with whatever I changed. And it may be, what may be happening to you is that you've downloaded this template. And it has color management off. And then you set a profile. When you click on the template, it's changing it back again. Is that you think that's what's happening, or.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:41.000
donaldboyd: Yeah, I think that probably is. That. That's what what was happening.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah. Yeah. So you know, that's how you update templates. I do this fairly often.

01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:42.000
donaldboyd: So.

01:14:46.000 --> 01:15:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um. If I make a little change or something like that well, I shouldn't say fairly often. If you, if you set it up properly, you don't need to do that often, but if you need to make a change. I decide that I want a slightly bigger or smaller margin. And I want to keep the same. Free template without creating a new one. Then I just right click. And do update with current update with current settings. Okay? And this update with current settings. By the way, is a very common. Theme in lightroom. So many things in lightroom. You can update like this. You just right, click and select update. So whether it's the template here, whether it's a snapshot in the develop module. Whether it's a preset in the develop module.

01:15:27.000 --> 01:16:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Whether it's a metadata preset. You right click. And you can update if you change something from the original from the original setting that you had. Anything, anything, anybody else, anything else before we sign off for today. I will make a little. Pdf of this and drop it in the in the replay, so that you guys can grab that in case you want to save that for your reference. Um, and I think. And our next print lab will. I'll talk a little bit more about. Some specifics with color management. I'll talk about black and white printing as well, and then. Of course we'll continue from there, and hopefully I can keep answering your questions about printing.

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Eventually I'd like to. Get some of you talking about your print workflow and sharing some prints so we can. We can all learn from what's going on. And what you guys are doing. Of course.

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000
Howard Krieger: Thanks, Robert.

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Alrighty!

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:22.000
Howard Krieger: Much appreciated.

01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000
donaldboyd: Great thanks a lot. Robert.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: All right. So if no one has anything else, then I'll let you guys go. Thanks for joining today and enjoy the rest of your day and your weekend.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:25.000
