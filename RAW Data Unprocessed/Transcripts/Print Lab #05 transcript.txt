Robert Rodriguez Jr: Hello! Everyone! Welcome! Welcome!

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Welcome everyone to our print. Lab number 5.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Great to see all of you here. If you.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Well, I'm not sure what else is going on in the rest of the country weather-wise, but if you're in the northeast we're pretty.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: We're pretty toasty up here right now. At the moment.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Mid nineties. So uh.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yes.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It is. It is quite warm.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I think it's gonna be warmer tomorrow. So.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Jerry Stachowski: Yeah, we got big.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Hopefully the uh.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Energy company doesn't go down because everyone's got their acs on multiple Acs.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Welcome, Jerry, Al Alan, David.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Jerry Stachowski: Yeah, we got baked in Colorado by a hundred degree heat.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Jerry Stachowski: Here on Friday and Saturday. So.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Ooh, alright! So you're getting it also.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Where? Where you uh? You're in Colorado, Jerry.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Jerry Stachowski: Uh-huh.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Where in Colorado.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Jerry Stachowski: Um. One of the suburbs of Denver.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay, so that that's.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Is that normal for this time of year is that.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Kind of hot.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Jerry Stachowski: It's kind of hot. It's about 15 degrees above normal.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, yeah, I was, gonna say, you're at an elevation there. So a hundred degrees, wow, yeah, that's that's pretty warm.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: All right. Well, hopefully, you're feeling staying cool.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Welcome, Howard! Welcome, Jeff.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Justine.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Karen Comstock, Karen, Kerwick.

Robert Rodriguez Jr: Steve. Welcome, Tamara.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And welcome. Virginia.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So it's great to see everyone here tonight.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Just bring my volume up here.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Alright. So let's see here comments.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A 100 in New Hampshire.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And humid.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yes, it is.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Alright! Well, thanks everyone for joining us tonight.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So today's our print lab number 5.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This is where we pretty much.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Just focus on printing and related.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Related topics.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It's great that a lot of our members are printing or interested in printing. So that's that's really great, because I've been.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I've been printing. Gee! Since pretty much. I started in my photography.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Almost 20 years ago.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So. Printing has always been a a big.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Part of my photography and.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Learning all about printing and exploring that, and.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Using that as a way to inform my work and.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Realize how much more I have to learn and grow.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But I love printing. It's once you experience it, and you share it with others. There's nothing quite like it. So.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This this past week. Last week I was.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: At the build expo in.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: New York, B. And H. Build, export. The Javits Center.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I did 2 talks there. One of them was on printing.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Not specifically printing, but capture to print.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And it was a great reception. A lot of people were interested in that. I had a.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Pretty much a full house in the stage that I was, on, which I think.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I think maybe set 250 people or more.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And after the.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: After I finished my my presentation.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Some people came up and said that they were happy, that I was talking about these things because.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: They? They wanted to hear more of that more of printing and.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um paper selection, those kinds of things which.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I guess it's not as.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Common or as harder to find online versus the typical things that we.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Find in terms of photography. So.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If you are new, of course I always.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: As um.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Suggest interacting. And so all you have to do is unmute your microphone.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Easy way to do that is to press your space bar.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I think that's set up by default in most computer systems. If you press your spacebar and you hold it down, that'll that'll unmute your mic.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then, when you let it go.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It'll mute it, mute it again.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And so, yeah, I always encourage.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Any questions or whatever, and so.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Tonight. I did have a few things that I want to share, just some minor things about.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Printing some tips. I also got some questions, one from Justine, about setting up note cards, so I I can.

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I want to talk about that as well.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But just to kick it off. Does anyone have any questions that was on their mind about printing.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Or printing related, etc. Anything you're struggling with, or.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Curious about, or confused about.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Anybody want to start us off tonight.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:42.000
Virginia Kolstad: Yes, I do. This is Virginia, Robert. I do my questions revolve around sending your photos out to print. Can you.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Virginia Kolstad: Speak to that at all.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, yeah, that's great. Thank you.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That's great, because actually, what some of the tips I'm going to share have to do exactly with that, because.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Another member had emailed me emailed me also about.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Sending um.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Sending his work out.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Virginia Kolstad: Okay. Thank you.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, no, no problem. So I guess I'll start with that. Um.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So I guess the 2 most important things are number one.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Select a a good printing service right? Someone that you either have been referred to good quality.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That, you know, is going to give you consistent results.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um. There are many out there.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So that's step number one, right?

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Because if you don't have a good printing service.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And they're not consistent.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The problem with that, of course, as you can imagine, then you're not sure what's going wrong, whether it's what you're sending them or what they're doing, what they're sending back, etc.

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um. I you know I'm happy to share my experiences. I really haven't used any other company.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I mean, I guess. Way back in the past I used 2 or 3 companies, but I don't remember if I was at a.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Photo convention, or what have you? But I someone recommended. Whcc. To me was a white House custom color. They're called.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And whenever I have needed to have something printed.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Outside. I've always used them, and I've always gotten consistent results. So good thing about that is that you know what you send them. You're going to get back.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Now in terms of exporting your images.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: From lightroom for sending.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You could do this in Photoshop also, but it's much easier in Lightroom. I think.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To export your images and get them set up, and so forth.

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: For for uh.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Using a printing service. So let me share my screen.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And 1st thing I'm going to do is let's just let's just well. A couple of tips.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Before you export. The 1st thing you want to think about is resolution. So.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: How much resolution do you have? Are you going to have enough resolution.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And because you're not necessarily going to be able to size it at a specific size.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Or you want to send.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Something that is the highest quality.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I suggest a couple of things. The 1st thing 1st thing is.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If I take any image here, so I'll just grab.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Oh, an image! Let's let's say.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This one here all right, and I go into the print module.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: One quick tip is to create what I call a sizer. So this is a a, basically, it's a, it's a, it's a.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A template, and all the Sizer is, and let me just turn my so you can see.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So down here you see in the template browser I have a template called Sizer.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That's just the name I gave it. But all this does is that it creates a.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Piece of paper that is really large.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So this piece of paper is like.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Well, let's find out. So if I click on page setup here.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This paper is 30 by 45 inches. Now, the way you create a.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Custom paper size doesn't matter what printer you have.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Is. Notice that it here says for any printer, but I can choose. One of my printers doesn't really matter. What you do is here you go into the paper size.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And you'll have your.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Presets here, but down at the bottom there'll be manage. Custom sizes.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And you click on this and.

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Then you can add your own custom size to this list. So you click on the plus sign.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You have a new size here, you can just call it whatever you want.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um, and then over here you would put in.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The size of the paper, and and I would make it big. And the reason for this is then you can experiment, or you can.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You can figure out.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: How much resolution you have for the print you want to make, and so I'll show you what I mean.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So let's set this width to 45 inches.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And the height to 30 inches. I already have one, but let's make another one.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And the borders don't don't matter here.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I'll just call this 30 by 45.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I'll hit, Ok.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: All right. And now you see that it went to a.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Vertical format. So let's switch this.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Assuming. I want a landscape.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And okay, what happened there.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Landscape. Yes.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Hmm.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Let me put this to any printer.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Switch this to landscape.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay, so let's try this.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Let's come back to this custom size here, manage custom, size.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And um.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Let's sometimes this can be a little weird. So let's switch this to.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: 30.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: By 45. So I'm switching the width and the height. And let's see what happens.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And now let's switch this to landscape.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay. So the width and height.

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Sometimes I'm not really sure which is which, depending on how you set it to landscape or.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Portrait. I just reverse them. And now you get.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Our landscape here. If I go back and click on portrait.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Then it switches to a portrait. Okay?

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So let's go back to landscaping.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So now, this is a really big piece of paper. Now, what you can do is let's say that you're going to print assuming you're not going to print larger than 30 by 45. Let's say you're going to print.

00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: 24 by 36.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: All right. So you come down here to the cell size, and you set the cell size to.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Height, 24, and the width.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: 36.

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay? And let's let's pick a vertical.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Image like that. Okay.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: 24 by 36.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That's the size of a hypothetical print that we're going to make.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: What you can do now is, though you can see here.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: As long as you have the print resolution unchecked.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This tells you what your native resolution is, for this file.

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: At a 24 by 36 size.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Now this image, the aspect ratio of this image doesn't actually work out to be 24 by 36. It works out to be 24 by 32.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But you get the idea. So what does this do? First? st It allows you.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Or, most most importantly, it allows you to see if you have enough resolution in your original file to print a 24 by 36.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Because if I were to send this file, as is at this size.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To a printing service, and I were to ask them to print it at 24 by 32 in this case.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: There's not enough information. There's not enough resolution.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And so you're not going to get a good quality print.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So you have 2 options. You can either.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Make a smaller print.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Or you can use something like super resolution.

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To double the size of the image.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So that of the file, so that now you do have enough resolution. So the purpose of this.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Step here. This sizer step, if you will, is just to see how much resolution you have.

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And what I would do in this case if I wanted to print 24 by 32.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I would use super resolution on this file.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To double the size of the image. That would. That will definitely give me enough information.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So, for example.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If I click here and I click on enhance.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: All right. It's moved over here. Forgot about that. That's another.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: New feature in Lightroom, this latest update that now they've moved the Denoise.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And the super resolution into the detail panel.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And also doesn't require you to create.

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A secondary or another Dng file. So that's 1 of the newest updates in.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Lightroom that just came on last week. So now you can basically.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Check, this super resolution.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It applies the super resolution to your file without creating a second one. So really, really, nice, update.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Now it prevents this duplicating of files that we had before.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And the other really cool thing is that.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If I uncheck this super resolution, then we're back to the original file. So it's actually completely non-destructive. Now.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: All right. I was actually going to talk about this in a future session. But I'm glad that it came up now, because we can see that. Okay.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So now I have the super resolution checked. If I go back to the print module.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You'll see that my PPI went up to 252.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And it was half that before.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So for this size I have enough information. Remember, the rule, generally speaking, is, you want to have above 180.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: At a bare minimum. Okay?

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So that's.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Thinking about the resolution, or making sure that you have enough information.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The second step would be exporting the file. So I'm going to come up here to file.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then export, and most, if not all, of the printing services.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um want you to send them a Jpeg. Very few of them.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If any, that I could think of at least the really good ones.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Unless you go to a custom print lab, most of them will not accept Psd or tiff files. They can be. Really, they can be really big. So they want Jpegs, which is not a disaster.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You can generate a really good looking Jpeg file.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um from lightroom, now.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: There's also Jpeg, Xl.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Which is a newer version of the Jpeg format that actually allows you to create an uncompressed or a lossless Jpeg means you don't lose any quality, however.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It's still not very well adopted yet by most.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Printing services, so most of them won't accept it. But I would ask.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Ask them if they'll take a Jpeg. Excel if they require a Jpeg.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If you're going to do Jpeg, or if you have to send Jpeg, then.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Few key things here. Number one.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Make sure that the quality setting here is all the way to 100, meaning you're going to get the best quality out of that Jpeg file.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That's step number one.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Step number 2 is.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um select a larger color space. So the Jpeg format.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Supports larger color spaces than Srgb. And if you remember, from our last print lab, Srgb is the smallest color space that's meant for displaying.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: On in a web browser on screen. But of course, if you're going to print.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The file. Most, if not all, of the printing services will will allow you to send a larger color space, and I would select adobe 98.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So that is the more or less the most popular color space for printing.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Pro photo. RGB is too large.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And so they're going to wind up, having to compress it.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So adobe 98 is your best bet. That is the most popular for printing.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Etc. So select adobe 98.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Make sure that everything else here is unchecked. You don't want to limit the file size or anything like that.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And the other thing is, you don't want to resize the image, so I would uncheck the resize here. So you're sending them.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Your raw file uh.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: At its original at its native resolution. It's going to be converted into a Jpeg.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But you don't want to resize it, and I wouldn't upsize it either, because.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You don't really know what's happening in terms of their printing and what they're doing, what kind of methods they're using. So I would just send them the most pristine file you can.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Which is going to be, you know. Don't resize.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um, and as far as.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Sharpening.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You can use this. Sometimes I.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Use it sometimes I don't. It's not going to hurt. If you know what kind of paper you're going to use.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Then you you can select here from matte or glossy paper.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So you know, you're going to use a matte paper. Just select matte paper, and again, the standard amount.

00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Is is good.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It's a happy medium between.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Low, which.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Very hard to discern any difference, and then high, which seems a little aggressive. So I would just go with standard.

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: On mad paper, or.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know, if you're going to print on a glossy paper, then choose Glossy. There.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And that's and that's basically it.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So if I were to export this now.

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It's going to ask me where I can select my desktop.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And on my desktop.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Here's the exported file, and you can see that it's 10.2 MB.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And that's going to give me a the best possible quality.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To send, not to upload to the printing service.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Does that cover everything, or answer everything for you? Virginia?

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Virginia's.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.000
Virginia Kolstad: Uh, yes, that's fine.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Was there anything else anything else that you wanted me to cover? Or.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
Virginia Kolstad: I had. I had somebody.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:31.000
Virginia Kolstad: Asked me that they had sent it to a reputable printing service, and it the colors had come back warmer than they saw on their screen.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Right.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:36.000
Virginia Kolstad: And they weren't sure why, I mean they had calibrated their screen.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.000
Virginia Kolstad: How can you avoid the color discrepancies that might occur.

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.000
Virginia Kolstad: Or what are your recommendations for that.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, I mean.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: See, the thing is.

00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um. You can only control what you can on your side, right? So if you.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If you know that your.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Monitors calibrated. If you've calibrated it.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And particularly if you're printing.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: At home. If you've got a printer at home and you run a test print, that's another thing you can do, just to be sure if you run a test print.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: At home, and it looks good to you. It more or less matches what you have on screen.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Then, once you send it off, that's it right. It's not in your hands any longer, so there's nothing you can really do to prevent a discrepancy.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That all depends on the quality control.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And the uh.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: More or less. The yeah. You know the the competency of the people. You're sending it to.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: There's really nothing else you can do about that.

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um. I can't speak for all the.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know, printing services.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Who knows what's happening over there? We know.

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: How difficult or not, how difficult, but.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: How um?

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Sometimes it can be a bit challenging for us to get our system working properly. Now you're sending it out to a commercial service that is maybe doing thousands of prints a day or hundreds a day don't really know.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Anything can happen. So the only thing I can suggest is.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To your specific question.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um try to find a reputable.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Consistent service, that.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You always get good.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know your good good feedback on. If somebody tells you that their prints are off, or they're warmer or cooler.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I would stay away.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.000
Virginia Kolstad: Okay. Thank you.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:25.000
thomasburnside: Hey, Robert? Uh! It's Tom.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:34.000
thomasburnside: I I'm glad you're covering this subject since we emailed on it earlier. I appreciate that. Um.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, sure.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:39.000
thomasburnside: I found out that Whcc. Will send up to 5 test prints.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:42.000
thomasburnside: For free, so hopefully that.

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:45.000
thomasburnside: Could make somebody comfortable about.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000
thomasburnside: These color discrepancies.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, great, great. Thank you. Thanks for letting me know that. Yeah. So I I um.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Tom had emailed me earlier today. That's where this came up. And he was going to use Mpix Mpix, I believe, and.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000
thomasburnside: Mpx, yeah. Was recommended to me.

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, sure. Sure, I have no um.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: No prior experience to Mpics. I can't say anything about them again. I can only tell you what my experience has been with Whcc.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I've used them for large prints, for small prints.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And because I've used them.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Often, not hundreds of times, but maybe I probably used them, maybe 10 times for different things that I needed done.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I've never had a single issue. I didn't even know about the test prints, but that's great to know. So there's another.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That's another thing. You can try, Virginia, which is, ask them for a test print. Maybe.

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Anyone you use. Say, will you send me a test print 1st before we run a large printer? If they say no, then.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know. Then you're rolling the dice.

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:46.000
thomasburnside: Yeah, somewhere somewhere on their website. There's a button to to click for that I don't know where, but I found it somehow.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah. And the other thing about Whcc. Again, I'm just giving you. My experience is you can call them. You can actually call them and speak to somebody, and you will talk to a human.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And you can say to them, you know.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Can I have a test print, or what have you? But yeah, that's an excellent.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I may have done a test print way long ago. Now it's coming back to me a little bit, getting a little envelope with different prints in the mail, maybe 10 years ago.

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But yeah, that's a that's an excellent way, because then, you know, for sure.

00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And not only that. If you get a test print.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And it matches like you're happy with it, and then you get your final print and it's off. Well, now you know that they'll they'll take care of you. You can easily say, here's the test print. It doesn't match up.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000
Howard Krieger: Justine doesn't make sure.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I may have had an issue with them.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Once before, and it wasn't a color discrepancy or anything like that. It was.

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000
Howard Krieger: Once before, and wasn't.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000
Howard Krieger: Any color, discrepancy.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I think it was a size thing, or what have you? And they they happily ran it again at the right size, so.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.000
Howard Krieger: I think.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So I mean like, I said. I can only vouch for who I've used.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000
Howard Krieger: Robert quick question. This is Howie.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, yeah, sure. Howard, how are you?

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.000
Howard Krieger: Can you hear me?

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:51.000
Howard Krieger: Great. Thank you. When you select super resolution.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.000
Howard Krieger: Do you in turn give up anything.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:59.000
Howard Krieger: You know, overall in terms of quality, or is it just so? Uh.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.000
Howard Krieger: You know, the algorithm is so perfect you're unaffected other than.

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000
Howard Krieger: Doubling the resolution.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Well, I wouldn't say you're.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I wouldn't say the algorithm is perfect.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You're you're probably.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know, you're probably sacrificing a tiny bit of overall.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Quality, and it's hard to quantify that exactly because you are doubling the image so.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000
Howard Krieger: And it's hard to.

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.000
Howard Krieger: Quantify exactly.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Lightroom is using a very good algorithm to take the raw file and double it. Basically.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Approximating what the next pixel would look like right.

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So it's really, really really good. I would say, if you're not printing large, then there's no need to.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To use it right? If you're just sharing online, or what have you.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But if you're printing large.

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um. Let me put it this way. The.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The potential. And again, I don't know. I haven't seen it. But the potential compromise that you're going to have with a tiny bit of loss of quality.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Is going to be made up by the fact that you'll have a lot more information to print.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You see. And so I think that, for example, with that previous image that I showed.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If I were to print it at 126 PPI. At 24 by 32. It's going to look worse.

00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Because it's going to look fuzzier, because there's just not enough resolution versus.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:17.000
Howard Krieger: Just like different, versus.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Using super resolution to increase the size and then printing it.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You'll you'll probably get a better result, and.

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.000
Howard Krieger: Yeah.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: All of the times that I've printed using super resolution.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know, to my eyes I haven't been able to see anything that I said. Oh.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um, you know there's a problem there. So I would say.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.000
Howard Krieger: Correct.

00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Is pretty. It's pretty good.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000
Howard Krieger: Good. Thank you. Appreciate it.

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah. Yeah. And as I mentioned before, um.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Coming back here again. This this was just released in.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In the latest version of Lightroom, so.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If I go to this image here.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This is my original image. It's Iso 800. On my older canon one Ds. Mark iii.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If I zoom in here.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To 200, you can see. That's pretty noisy.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You can see all the noise there, and.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Previously I would use the enhance function to.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Denoise, I would click and then do enhance, and then that would create a separate file.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A separate Dng file, a second Dng file that actually was renamed.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To enhanced.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Well, now they they've made it completely non-destructive. So if I go into the develop module.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Here's the detail panel again.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I've got Denoise.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And raw details, so I can click on Denoise.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And it actually applies the Denoise.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: As a non-destructive edit, which means that.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: No new files, and I can take it off anytime. I want.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Which is very, very nice.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That's something that a lot of people were asking for.

00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So there's the Denoise, and you can see how cleaner that is much cleaner than it was before.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: My detail and sharpness is still there.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Also um.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Tom, I think you had mentioned in your email that you had some.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Or you thought you had some issue with.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The temperature, changing with detail, or denoising.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I have never, ever seen that. So that should not have you know the other thing. Well, let me just say that the.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The Denoise, and the sharpening.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In Lightroom, one of the.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Cool features of lightroom is that, and this is a little bit more technical, but it only sharpens the luminosity channel.

00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It doesn't sharpen the.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: RGB. Channels, which means that the sharpening shouldn't in theory and in practice shouldn't affect their colors whatsoever. So you can see here that.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know, if I let's come up here to the.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Let's just add a little bit of vibrance and saturation here, just to saturate that a little bit.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If I come down now to the detail panel, and I uncheck. Well, actually, let me add some sharpening.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Right. So I'm adding some sharpening, or use some masking to mask off.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Some of the areas of the image that I don't want any sharpening on.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So again, the black area means that none of that is getting. If I turn the masking off.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The entire image is being sharpened.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If I now increase the sharpening, you see that the sharpening is removed or masked off from the sky and the dark mountain areas, because.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: There's no real detail there. The sharpening remains on the edges.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: No change in color. Okay.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And if I uncheck Denoise.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Let's say I don't want to use Denoise, for whatever reason.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Now it's off. Color stays the same.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: All the noise comes back right. You can see how much noisier it got now.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If I use the manual.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Noise reduction. You can do that as well.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I can come down here, take a little bit of that off.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Carlin Noise. Reduction.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'm fairly aggressive. So luminosity is up to what 45.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: 50 colors up to about 45.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And it's still not as clean as it was.

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: With the Denoise.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I can still see a tiny bit of noise in there. You can see that.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So I'm going to reset the noise. Reduction.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Take it off completely. I'll take off the color noise as well. You can see it gets very noisy.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: By the way, whenever I.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Do a lightroom class or teach lightroom. What have you? And I'm trying to show.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The difference between luminance, noise, and color, noise.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I always struggled to find an image. And yet here's the perfect example.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Of color, noise, and luminosity noise. So if I zoom in.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The color noise is what looks like.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Sprinkles. Okay, red and green spots there. And that's what the color noise reduction does.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The color noise, reduction control. So you see, when I use the color noise, reduction.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The colored noise goes away. Now I still have the luminance noise. The luminance noise is in the.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It's just like grain, basically just black and white noise.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And now that's what the luminous noise is for, and I can remove that.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Even still, as I said, it still looks a bit noisy, so let me take turn this off.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I'm going to come back up here and check Denoise again.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And you can see.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It's cleaner. The other thing that's interesting is that the second time I applied the Denoise it took the noise away instantly.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Which means that lightroom is probably cached.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: What the image looked like with the Denoise, so that if you apply it again you don't have to wait the 20 seconds again.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So again, another nice sort of.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Performance, feature. There.

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:50.000
steve guercia: Robert, I have a a question about um.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.000
Karen: I have a quick.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:55.000
steve guercia: Color shift when you go from your monitor to a print.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.000
steve guercia: If you print something on a given paper.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.000
steve guercia: Acme semigloss, whatever it is.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.000
steve guercia: And you discover.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.000
steve guercia: To offset the color shift that might occur.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.000
steve guercia: Let's say you have to adjust some slider by 20%.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:17.000
steve guercia: Is it the case that every time you use that paper.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:26.000
steve guercia: You need to adjust that slider by that same 20%? Or does it vary from photograph to photograph, and you essentially stop from scratch every time.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Uh second option.

00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um remember that.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Well, the second option, except I would advise against doing either one.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But yes, um.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Color shifts are going to happen.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Well when they happen they shouldn't happen. But if and when they happen right, they're happening, because.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: An image has different colors. The colors combine in different ways, and if you get a color shift.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know, if you try to adjust it.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You're talking about the mixing of red, green, and blue in different amounts and different proportions.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If it, if you adjust it in a certain way that eliminates the color shift for one image. Now you go to a different image.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And let's say that you had to reduce the blue. Well, you reduce the blue by a certain amount, for that image.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You go to a different image now, and that image has a color shift. Perhaps when you print it.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But the I'm sure.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That the blue is going to be mixed in a different proportion, slightly different proportion. And so your.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Post adjustment now may not remove the color shift.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To the degree that you expected.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: However, I I strongly suggest you avoid that for this very reason, because you're going to have to make custom adjustments to every picture.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Which really is very inefficient, so.

00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: What's the solution? Well.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In theory, with a good paper.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay, um, not acme, but.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know Hana Mula Cansan.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Even Red River, if they've got good profiles.

00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And that the key is the profile, so that the answer is in the profile.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If you, if you have a good profile, you should not have any color shifts.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Now, I'm sure.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You've wondered. Well, when should I have a custom profile made if I can.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Get a generic profile. A lot of folks talk about custom profiles.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Well, this is one of those reasons. Oh, this is one of those times.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If you have a paper that you're using regularly, that.

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You like, and the profile that you got from the manufacturer is.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: More or less, giving you a color shift.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Then you need to make a custom profile.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Why? Because.

00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You're making a custom profile for your specific printer. That is the big.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Variable in the equation. In other words.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The profile that you're downloading from the manufacturer, Canson, Honda Mueller. Whatever.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That profile was created for their printer. Even if you've got the same printer, even if you've got a.

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Epson, p. 800, and they've got an Epson, p. 800.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It was created using their p. 800.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And it is possible, and in fact, it's it was more likely in the past that.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The printers, even though coming off the same assembly line.

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The tolerances are slightly different.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: They might have a slight.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Something different about the printer, and that's why a custom profile is the only thing that will guarantee.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Or should guarantee in theory a.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Perfect, or a close to perfect match.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: With your setup. Okay?

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um. So that's that's that's what I would I would say if you've got a paper that you really like.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Then you can have a custom profile made for that paper. It's going to cost you.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I don't know. Maybe 60 to 70 bucks something like that. You um.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The the company. There's a couple of companies online that make custom profiles.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: They'll send you some files. You print them on the paper, you ship the paper to them, they scan it, and then create a profile.

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And the reason why they need to scan.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The print made on your printer is because now they take into account your printer, and how it is.

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Interpreting and printing the colors.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Does that make sense.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, yeah, so.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000
Karen: I have a question. Um.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Sure.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.000
Karen: Going back to the resolution.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:33.000
Karen: Your photo use for for an example was a D and G, and then you convert it to a.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000
Karen: Jpeg. To be sent out.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.000
Karen: Now I I haven't.

00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:44.000
Karen: Looked at it yet, but I took a photo with my iphone. I forgot to turn it to raw. So it's a Jpeg.

00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:48.000
Karen: And I haven't checked the resolution on it.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.000
Karen: Yeah. And I'm.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.000
Karen: Wondering, can you, if I need to.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.000
Karen: Do I do the same thing with the super resolution.

00:34:55.000 --> 00:35:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Sure, no. Well, actually, super resolution, no super resolution, only works on raw files.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:57.000
Karen: Okay.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:02.000
Karen: All in one. Okay.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, yeah, the super resolution. And the Denoise only works on raw files. So.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And that's what that's why it's so good in lightroom is because it is actually working on the raw data.

00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Once you have something like a jpeg, then it's kind of baked in.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If you really wanted to print the large, then you would have to use.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A you could use um.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I mean, I guess you could export it in a lightroom and upsize it, but you can use something like.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know Gigapixel, or.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Even Photoshop to resize the image, to give you more resolution. But the.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:36.000
Karen: Okay.

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The super resolution and the Denoise.

00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Is specific or or limited to raw files only.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I think that's where that's where we're getting such good results, because it actually is operating at the.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: At the raw at the raw level. If you will.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.000
Karen: Right? So resizing in Photoshop.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:55.000
Karen: Will up the resolution.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, yeah, you can go into Photoshop. And you know, you can just say, make it.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.000
Karen: I don't think really big, but.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Bigger, and I would make it as I would only make it as large as whatever print you wanted to make. So.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If you want to print an iphone photo and you want to make it 20 by 30.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Then in Photoshop, I would upsize it to 20 by 30 at 300 PPI. And I would do 300. That's just a.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.000
Karen: Right.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It's just a good standard to use, and Photoshop will increase it.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And you know it'll look. It'll I mean again. I can't.

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Depends on your image. But if you're not.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Upsizing too big like if you've got a more recent iphone.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: 1415, even 13. It should be fine.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah.

00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um, so there's a question here from Mildred. I lost some of my printing templates in lightroom. Any suggestions where to download templates.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: For lightroom, classic, for.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Ah hmm um.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:37:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I don't know of any. Personally. There are. I'm sure there may be places where you can download templates that give you different layouts, but I don't know of any.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Any, in specifically, so.

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I can't help you there. Maybe a quick search.

00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, if you lost, I mean, if you lost some templates and you more or less know they're not that hard to recreate. I recently had to recreate some templates.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: When I moved from my PC. To the Mac. And some of the templates just didn't come for the ride, and so I.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Recreated them. What I did want to show while we're here is.

00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And let me change here again.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So, Justine, are you with us? I was going to talk about the note cards.

00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So Justine asked me about printing.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In note cards, and so I was going to show you how to set that up.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Very, very quickly. So I'm going to take a.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: We'll take any image here, and I'm going to go to the print module.

00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And so the 1st thing you have to do for note cards is, you have to decide or not decide. You have to.

00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Determine what size.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Note card you want to print.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: What size your note card is, and I think Justine said that her note cards were 7.4 by 11. If I'm not mistaken.

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So, as an example, I have.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Here's a template that I have for note cards.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And this is for some commercial note. Cards that I print pretty regularly.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The only problem with this note card is that.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The image is upside down.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And so for this template I have to flip the image.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: 180 degrees, and so I can just come down here and say, rotate.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Once, and then rotate again.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And now it'll print the right way, and I can.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Choose here what part of the image I want to include in the.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I want to print, because to print this image at this size I have to crop it a little bit. There's no way around it. I'm just limited by the note card size.

00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And so up here I've got zoom to fill turned on.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If I turn this off, then you'll see that.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I got white space, and I want to fill this cell.

00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Exactly so. I have to turn zoom to fill on.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Now, okay, so let me just show you 1st how to set this up. So I would go into page set. This is very similar to before with the Sizer.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I would again go into the paper size here. So I click on page setup.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Go into paper size, come down to manage custom sizes.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And here you can add your own custom, size.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So I'm going to click on the plus sign.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I'm going to say.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.000
Justine Carson: Yeah, it was 7.4 by 11.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay, great. Thank you. 7 point.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: 4 by 11 height. It's already set there.

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: One thing is, you want to turn off the margins, the user-defined margins. I want to set these all to 0.

00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Right. All 0 margins.

00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: 7.4 by 11.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'll type in here. Note, card.

00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: 7, by 11.

00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then I hit, Ok.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I've got it selected here.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I hit. Ok, I'm gonna get rid of this logo for now, because that's not going to be relevant for us, for now.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Now, the next thing you want to do is you want to set your margins all around. Now.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: For me. I like to leave a little margin of.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Roughly point 1 2 inches that just works out to be very thin, and it's probably the smallest margin you can get.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Now, before I do this, you may be wondering, why do you have to print the note card at the top when I put it at the bottom.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So like this.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay. Why not? Why not print it like this.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Well, funny enough. The reason is, I actually.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And what I mean is what I'm talking about is.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Printing it like this.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: All right, let's forget the margins, for now, just as an idea.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The reason the reason why I print that at the top, and I flip it upside down, and I have forgotten. But I actually tried it today, I said, Why can't I do it at the bottom? And I printed it out.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I don't know if it's.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: On my Canon printer. But maybe this was the same with the Epson printer as well. I don't remember now.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The point is, and I'll show you now very quickly.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: When I printed it like this.

00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So maybe hard to see the top. But there's a bigger border in the bottom.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: There's a bigger border on the bottom than there is in the top. So the top it goes. The the picture goes almost to the top of the image.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To the top of the card, and there's a bigger border in the bottom. So this is when I printed it like this.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: When I flipped it around and and reversed the image upside down and put it at the top. Now the paper gets fed into the printer.

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: From this side but the.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Print prints on this side, whereas if I print it like this.

00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The paper gets fed on this side, and the image gets printed on this side. So when I.

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Did it with the image on the top.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The borders were perfectly even all around.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So you can see this one. There's a bigger border on the bottom. Guys. See that.

00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:13.000
Justine Carson: Mhm.

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So I don't know why that happens.

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That's just the way it is. Again. I think it has to do with the paper being fed. Okay.

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So what I do is, let's just set this up as if we were going to print it with the image on top. Of course for this to work.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You have to turn the image around.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:32.000
Karen: You have to put it up so we can see it.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Oh, right sorry yep.

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So I just flipped the image around.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: 180 degrees. You can also do that.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Very easily here. So this, let's say, this is the image that I want to print. You got these 2 arrows here.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So I'm just going to flip it around like that.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Going to print. And so we want to set our borders. So I'm going to set my left margin to 0 point 1 2.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'm going to set my right margin to 0 point 1 2.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'm going to set my top margin up here.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To point 1 2.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And now we need to set our bottom margin.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Now, the way I calculate the bottom margin is the mark. The bottom margin needs to be.

00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Point 1 2 inches beyond the midpoint of.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The paper, because the midpoint is where we're going to fold the paper.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And so, if the paper is 11 inches high.

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Then the midpoint is.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: 5 and a half.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But we need to make it a little bit higher than that.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So it's going to be 5.6 2. So 5 and a half, plus 0 point 1 2.

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It's 5.6 2. So I'm going to come over here to the bottom, and I'm going to move this bottom.

00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Margin to 5.6 2. Now, that's going to be pretty hard to do. So I'm just going to type in here.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: 5.6 2 like that.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And the reason why.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It's not expanding all the way to the edges all the way to the margins is because we now have to come over here and expand the cell size.

00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So that it fills that entire area. So here's the height.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And here's the width, and it'll come all the way out to.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The margins that we set. Now, if you if I if you look at my mouse here, I'm going to move my mouse.

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To, and you can see, as I move my mouse, the little marker here is moving on the ruler.

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So there's 5 and a half right there.

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And you can see from the tip of the mouse to the.

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Image is the other point 1 2, so that'll give us.

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That same white space all around.

00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The image. All right.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So that's how we set that up. Also. Remember, I have the zoom to fill turned on, because, depending on the card.

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You may not have the perfect size to fit.

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So I'm going to turn on zoom to fill, and you have the option here to move this around to select the.

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The image that you want to. You know that you want to show in the window, so to speak.

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'm not a big fan of of cropping like this, you guys know that. But if you're making note cards it's just one of those compromises that you'll.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know, you have to kind of deal with, based on the paper size that you're using.

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay? And that's basically it. Now, if you want to add something down here.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: On the back of the card, not inside, but on the back. That's where you can.

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Use the identity plate.

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And the identity plate is down here in the page area, and if I turn this on.

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That was the identity plate that I showed you before. This is just a graphic that I created in Photoshop. So it's a a graphic.

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: All of this is made in Photoshop, and then I just pulled it into the identity plate. Here.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And told Lightroom to put it there. So if you.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Over here and click on this downward looking little triangle right there.

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You can say edit.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And if you have another file, for example.

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um. You can click on that.

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Oh, and here's another one that I made recently. So let's click on that.

00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I hit. Ok. And this is another little graphic that says, land and sky with my name, something that I'm doing for a portfolio.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You can make this bigger or smaller.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then you can. You can center it wherever you want, and this will print on the back of the card, so this could be your logo, or design your name, whatever you want.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:14.000
Karen Kerwick: Robert is Karen Kerwick. Um.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah.

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.000
Karen Kerwick: Can you actually add print.

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:19.000
Karen Kerwick: On the other side. If you want to put like a greeting or something in there, text.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:21.000
Karen Kerwick: The text box.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You can't. Well, you'd need a double-sided paper, and I don't know of any double-sided note cards.

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So, yeah.

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:31.000
Karen Kerwick: Okay. So you have a fold line right?

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, I mean, you could use. So the.

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:40.000
Karen Kerwick: So you'd have to be. Turn it over and print. Make it another template for that side, then, separately, is what you're saying.

00:46:42.000 --> 00:46:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Well, no. What I'm saying is that you would need to use a paper that allowed you to print on both sides.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And you could use.

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A standard paper like, you know, without the fold line, and you'd have to fold it. But I've tried that, and the fold line never really looks that good. It looks kind of.

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know, makeshift the note cards, the commercial note cards.

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Have an actual fold line. They have a crease. Sometimes they even have a cut on the paper, and so when you fold it over.

00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It folds very cleanly, and it looks really good, but I don't know of any note. Cards.

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That are double-sided. Maybe Red River has. I don't know if anyone knows about that.

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:27.000
Virginia Kolstad: Yes, uh, Robert, I do. I I do! I I buy my note. I buy my note cards from Red Brothers, Virginia. I buy my note cards from Red River paper.

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay. Yeah. So Alan said, Yeah.

00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:31.000
Virginia Kolstad: And they have a template that you can download to Lightroom and Photoshop.

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:38.000
Virginia Kolstad: But I do print on the reverse side with them. And it's really not a problem at all. It's plain it's not the coated paper that's on the picture side.

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay. Yeah.

00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:41.000
Virginia Kolstad: But you don't really need it for print. So.

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, yeah, great. Yeah. So there you go. So then, excellent. So whatever has it? Yeah. So.

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You would just have to do a template on the other side.

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And what I would do for sure is.

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I would create the.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Text in Photoshop as a.

00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: As a file.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.000
Karen Kerwick: Right.

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then I would bring it into, and I would do just like what I have here like this. So I would just.

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know, you can either bring it as an image or bring it as an identity plate.

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So, for example, if I.

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:07.000
Karen Kerwick: Okay.

00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:14.000
Virginia Kolstad: Or or you can print it in Photoshop, you know. Just create the the print in Photoshop.

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:19.000
Virginia Kolstad: You know, run the picture through lightroom and then run it through Photoshop for the print.

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, you could do that also.

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:21.000
Virginia Kolstad: For the, for the, for the letters.

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, you could do it for the text. Yeah, you could do that also. So.

00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:24.000
Virginia Kolstad: Yeah, right.

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So yeah, so that's how you. That's how you would do that.

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:26.000
Justine Carson: So you would.

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:31.000
Justine Carson: So you'd be running the same piece of paper through the printer twice.

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.000
Virginia Kolstad: Yes.

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:38.000
Justine Carson: Does that cause any issues with? Uh? I don't know. Smudging, I guess if you let it dry thoroughly it might not.

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.000
Virginia Kolstad: Right.

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, it doesn't. It doesn't happen. I mean, I've done double-sided, not note cards, but other things on regular paper, and it's fine.

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um, yeah, it's it's it's fine. So yeah, it dries pretty quick. These inks are. They're pretty quick drying. You don't have to wait like.

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know you can run it. You could pretty much run it within minutes. You don't have to wait.

00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:58.000
Justine Carson: Billings.

00:48:58.000 --> 00:48:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A long time to do it, so.

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:04.000
donaldboyd: Uh, Robert, I I believe Red River has a double sided map paper.

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yep.

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:06.000
donaldboyd: The polar mat. I think.

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay, all right. Great. Yeah. So so there you go. Yeah. So you would just.

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Do it the other way. But um.

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, you could either lay out that. You know the thing about um.

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Photoshop is, you would also have to lay out the you would have to create a document that was the same size as your note card, and then you can lay out the text and then run.

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The paper through or.

00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If you if you wanted to stay in lightroom, you could just create.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The document in Photoshop, export it as a Png, and then import it into lightroom or not, import it, but use it as a.

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Or you actually, you would import it as a text file and as as an image, and then just place it at the top here. So.

00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Whichever way.

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.000
Karen Kerwick: Okay. Thank you.

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, you're welcome.

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:53.000
Justine Carson: Yeah, Robert, that was very helpful. Now, one of the other problems I had with the template that I created was that if I.

00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:56.000
Justine Carson: Create, you know, if I wanted to do a.

00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:01.000
Justine Carson: A horizontal print like this. Then the spacing seemed fine.

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Sure.

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:05.000
Justine Carson: If I wanted to do a vertical. Theoretically.

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:08.000
Justine Carson: The same template should work.

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: No, no, you have to redo the template.

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:09.000
Justine Carson: What's.

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:12.000
Justine Carson: Okay.

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yep. So if I let's click on plus over here, and I'm just gonna say, no.

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Card.

00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: 7, by 11.

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um.

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Horizontal.

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay? And then I'm going to click on page setup and flip this to a.

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This orientation. Okay? You see, it doesn't work at all. And also.

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um. We don't need now to.

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Flip the image, because.

00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: We want it to be on the right side. If it stays on the left side, it's on the wrong side of the card right.

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So I'm going to flip the image again.

00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.000
Justine Carson: Right.

00:50:55.000 --> 00:51:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay? And then we're just going to reverse the dimensions. So instead of the right side being 5.6 2.

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Which pushes the image to the left.

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'm going to make the right side point 1 2.

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I'm going to make the left side.

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: 5.6 2.

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:15.000
Justine Carson: Mhm.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay. And now it's on the right side. It'll open and close the right way with the image.

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then um! I can take my.

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: My logo here. What have you.

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: We can come down to the identity plate area. I can.

00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Flip the orientation, so it says, no rotation.

00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I can put that there if I like.

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay. And now you've got your vertical card, and then I'm just going to.

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Save the template again.

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um.

00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay, and just call it vertical. So now I can go between the vertical and the.

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Uh the.

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Where is it? Here?

00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:57.000
Justine Carson: Horizontal. Yeah, thank you.

00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:01.000
Justine Carson: Mhm, yeah, I see it. Note card, 7 by 11, horizontal.

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Oh, here it is. Sorry. Yep, right so, and that the beauty of the templates is you can go between the 2 very simply like that. Of course.

00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The only difference is whether you have to flip the image or not.

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:15.000
Justine Carson: Okay.

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Like that. Okay, if um, for for example, like I, if you're doing note cards.

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:17.000
Justine Carson: Right.

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um, you know different images and just doing it at your.

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know, at your at your own leisure. What have you.

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Then this is fine. If you create like a note card set. So let's say you create a set of note cards which I have. I have several.

00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And they always have the same. 4 or 6 or 8 images.

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay, and you sell those as a set. Then what I did was.

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The 8 images that were in that set. I.

00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Created virtual copies for those 8 images.

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I put those virtual copies inside their own collection, and I flip them all.

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Upside down. And so now, whenever I go to make note cards, I use the images in that collection.

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And this way I don't have to be flipping the images up and down. But again, that's because I'm printing those pretty regularly. And so it was.

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It was useful to have a separate collection.

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Virtual, you know, with virtual copies.

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Flipped upside down.

00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:13.000
Justine Carson: Okay. Um.

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:18.000
Justine Carson: Well, so my last question, I guess, related to that is, do you have any idea how.

00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah.

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:21.000
Justine Carson: The template would have gotten.

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:22.000
Justine Carson: Changed.

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yes, I I do.

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I do. Yeah. So.

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This is the tricky thing about templates in lightroom.

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And, I would say, presets also, but particularly with templates. So.

00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:36.000
Justine Carson: Okay.

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Anytime. There's a printer driver, update.

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:39.000
Justine Carson: Uh-huh.

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That can break the template, because the template.

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Think about the template as it.

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um. It reads.

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The location of the different windows and menus in the printer driver.

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And you know as well as I do that Epson.

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Particularly. Epson, has a habit of changing.

00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The menus around in the driver. I'm talking about.

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know this window here. So when you go up to the page setup.

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This window here, and also the print settings.

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It changes. Okay.

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um so that can.

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If there's a printer driver, update that can.

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Break the template.

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Every so often depending on. Well, I don't think it happens with lightroom updates. So I think it's just a function of the printer and the drivers.

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um, and sometimes the printer driver will.

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Rename, or change the naming of the paper sizes, and then that'll.

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That'll cause an issue. So.

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:33.000
Justine Carson: Mhm.

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:35.000
Justine Carson: Okay.

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Does that sound familiar like maybe like something that could have happened.

00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:43.000
Justine Carson: Yeah, that's it's possible, because I think it was. Probably, you know, at least 6 months or so between.

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:48.000
Justine Carson: Printing like maybe in December I printed a bunch of cards, and then in.

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:53.000
Justine Carson: May. I tried to use the template again, and it just wasn't working.

00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah. You remember updating the driver between that time.

00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:00.000
Justine Carson: I may have, I may have.

00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It's hard. Yeah, yeah.

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:01.000
Justine Carson: Yeah.

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, that's more likely. Something like that. It's not probably a lightroom update. It's a driver update.

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:07.000
Justine Carson: Mhm.

00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'm hesitant to say an operating system update because.

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That doesn't change what's happening in the driver. So.

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But driver updates will definitely change things for sure.

00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:16.000
Justine Carson: Okay.

00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In terms of templates. The driver will change things now in terms of color.

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And color management that can be influenced.

00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: More by the operating system. So if you update your operating system.

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Sometimes the operating system.

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Changes something the way it's managing color.

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That doesn't quite doesn't quite work with the current driver. And typically what you'll see is.

00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Either lightroom will have an update or the printer. The canon or Epson will release an update.

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To fix that issue that's happened to me in the past. So.

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Anybody else, any other.

00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Any other questions.

00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: On printing.

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Think I covered everything I wanted to talk about in terms of.

00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The tips for exporting.

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And the note cards.

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Anybody else.

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:10.000
Justine Carson: Hmm.

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Any new papers anybody's using.

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:20.000
Justine Carson: No.

00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That they want to share.

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, I can't. I can't quite remember the um.

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Service that will create custom profiles, but I'll look it up afterwards, and I'll post it.

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And the replay link, or what have you? I want to say? It's.

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I can't remember now. Sorry I can't remember the name, but there are. There are a few.

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And they're pretty much independent people that have a.

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Printing studio and offer this service to create custom, profiles.

00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:52.000
Jerry Stachowski: Robert. I'm using freestyle photo, and Eric Joseph is.

00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah.

00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah. Oh, yeah.

00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:57.000
Jerry Stachowski: Creating the profiles, and his profiles are $99, just for reference.

00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Thank you.

00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay, yep, thank you for that. I know, Eric. That's another option. So Eric, Joseph Freestyle photo.

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: He charges 99 bucks. They've gone up a little bit in price. They used to be more like the 60 70 range, but.

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But yeah, so that's for, as I said, like to get a custom profile that that will be perfectly matched for your paper.

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: As a side note. Um.

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A good paper manufacturer, or I should say.

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If they really care about making sure that their papers.

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Are well.

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Perceived. Right. They're going to put time and attention into creating.

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Good profiles, or the best profiles they can.

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The other thing is that you'll probably have better luck with a newer printer versus an older printer in terms of.

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Using one of these generic profiles because.

00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The newer printers.

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Maybe printers made in the last 3, 4 years.

00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Have. They're just built better right? They have better.

00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Tolerance, standards so.

00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'm talking about Epson, p. 800, Eps. And p. 900.

00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Canon pro 1,100 200 300, pro 1,100.

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Their manufacturing is better, and so, because the tolerances are much less.

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The generic profiles will work for most of them. The older printers there used to be much bigger differences between the printers.

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Older, 38 82,400.

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:14.000
Justine Carson: Mhm.

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Canon, 55,000 5,100. They had.

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: More potentially more discrepancy between the printers which.

00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Means that one profile is not going to work for all the different printers out there. Perfectly.

00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:36.000
steve guercia: Robert? Do profiles ever change.

00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: No, no, no! Profile is.

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If it's if you don't change your printer and you're not changing the paper. Then.

00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah. The profile.

00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Remember, the profile is created for the printer that you're using.

00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And the paper that you're using, and as long as neither one changes.

00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Then it should work perfectly fine.

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:06.000
Justine Carson: Okay. Um, Robert. One last thing I mean not answer tonight, but looking forward.

00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Sure.

00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:11.000
Justine Carson: Um. You had mentioned at 1 point that you would maybe do some sessions on using.

00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:13.000
Justine Carson: The book module. Um.

00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Mhm.

00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:16.000
Justine Carson: So do you have definite plans for that.

00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, that's coming. That's coming next. That's coming very soon. In fact, you can see the little logo that I had.

00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Here. That's part of my preparation for the book module session. So yeah, in the next.

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:26.000
Justine Carson: Oh!

00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In the next month or so, for sure. We'll talk about that. That's part of the creating a portfolio.

00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:34.000
Justine Carson: Mhm.

00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And so we'll talk about using the book module, and I'll show you some examples as well.

00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:40.000
Justine Carson: Okay? And you use the book module. Um.

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:44.000
Justine Carson: And do you send it to Blurb, or do you send it elsewhere? Yeah.

00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Well, no, no, the so the book module in lightroom is integrated with blurb.

00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:50.000
Justine Carson: Oh, integrated with lerb, okay.

00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, so that's that's.

00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I would say. That's 1 of its strengths is that you create the whole thing in lightroom.

00:59:56.000 --> 01:00:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And you actually send it to blurb and pay for everything in lightroom. So there's no exporting of files, nothing. And then you get the book in the mail.

00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:58.000
Justine Carson: Mhm.

00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:00.000
Justine Carson: Right.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Justine Carson: Yeah.

01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In a couple weeks. So yeah, it makes it very can be very easy and.

01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know, given.

01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Given. The you know the.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Capability. I would say the quality is pretty good, right? Like you're not sending it out to a professional pre-press that's going to cost you thousands of dollars to make.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Couple 100 books. You can make one book.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And it's pretty damn impressive, I would say.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Karen Kerwick: I did the a book with Blurb using. Go through lightroom, and you send them a Pdf. And uploaded that.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Karen Kerwick: For the different parts, and it was of my niece's graduation, and she was thrilled with it. So it turned out really nice.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Karen Kerwick: But I only had one copy made, so it is a little expensive, for I think it was about 96 bucks, for it.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Sure.

01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:48.000
Karen Kerwick: But she loved it. That was her presence.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah. How did it turn out.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:54.000
Karen Kerwick: It did really nice. Yeah, really impressed. So it worked really, well.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, I made. I made one. Many years ago. I took a family trip.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: My family and I went to Italy, maybe 8, 9 years ago.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And we made the largest book that they offered for whatever the cost was, and I gave it as a gift to my wife, and, like, you know.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Like that's that's treasured possession in the house. She shows it to everybody. So.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know, having a book. It could be.

01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Your work. It could be a trip if it could be a vacation. I think it's pretty fantastic, and a nice way.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Especially if you're the photographer in the family, or your group, or what have you? It's a nice way to really.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Bring your your work and express it in a different way. So I think it's underutilized. So I want to try to.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Explore that a bit and help you guys out with maybe.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Uh trying it so.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Alright guys. Well, thanks very much. I think if that's it for tonight, we pretty much hit the hour, mark. So.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Appreciate it again. Thanks for the all the great questions. I hope that was.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Helpful. Our next print lab will be looking at a few of the topics.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um more to do with editing, and also with.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Using, trying and using different papers, optimizing the papers for your image, and that whole.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Topic of complementing one with the other, to create.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um, something really really special, really unique.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Karen Kerwick: Thank you. Robert.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000
Karen: Alright. Thank you.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Alright. Thanks everybody. Um.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Karen: Thank you.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:14.000
donaldboyd: Thanks, Robert.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:18.000
