00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Hello, everyone! Welcome to another creative path. Academy. Live session! Great to have all of.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You hear with me as usual.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um. We are excited about tonight's session because we're gonna be talking about something that I particularly enjoy in Lightroom, which is the book module.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Making books, which is just again another way of.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Sharing your work.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I just want to say hello to everyone that is joining us tonight. All the members tonight. Here it's great. Al, Harry.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Ellen, Jean-marie, Jeff.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Jerry, Joanne, welcome, Joanne.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Justine, Michelle.

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Welcome, Mike! Welcome, Mildred.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Welcome, Patricio, Steve, Virginia.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Martha, Bob.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Great great to see everyone joining me here.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: On a what has been a.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A really nice week here, weather-wise in the northeast.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Weather's gotten a lot better than it was, or at least.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Easier to enjoy than it was a few weeks ago. With the high humidity and so forth.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So yeah, as I mentioned um.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This is kind of a continuation.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Of the theme that I started, or we started.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In our last session about.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Projects and portfolios.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: There is certainly a lot more to talk about that. And I definitely want to go deeper into that.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: How to start a portfolio, or how to start a project really.

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The portfolio usually comes after the project.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: How to start a project, how to think about a project, different things that.

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Different ideas, and.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Considerations you can take, but.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I wanted to get into a little bit of the practical nature of.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A project or portfolio.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Particularly because we have so many lightroom users. The majority of the members are lightroom users.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The book module is a part of lightroom.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And so it's a really, I think, great way to.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Share your work in the past.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Creating a book, was.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Difficult, you know, if you wanted to make your own book. It was difficult.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Inexpensive. That was the key thing.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Expensive and difficult, because you need it to be fairly.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Comfortable with graphic design. Software.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Stuff like adobe, indesign.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You had to basically do everything from scratch. You can get a template and things like that. But then there was the question of getting all the files in getting the right sizes, the resolutions, the color spaces, so many different things that went into.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Printing a book and lightroom has made that much easier.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Because they have incorporated, or, I should say, integrated.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Blurb and blurb is a.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I'll show you in a moment. Blurb is a service that has been around for a while.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And they make it fairly easy to create beautiful books, one-off books, and that was the other thing. With making your book before making a book before, which is that.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Typically you would have to have made you had a minimum right? You have to make.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A 100 copies, or 200 copies, or whatever.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And now with digital technology, you can.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Essentially make one book, you know, fully bound Hardcover book.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So that is really really nice. It's going to be more expensive than, of course, making 500.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But I see it more as.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: An investment as a way to really enjoy your photography and to share. That's the key thing. Share in another format.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That is a pretty unique kind of like Prince, where.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: There's the tactile, tangible.

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Aspect to paper.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This is kind of a similar thing, I think, even more so when it comes to just having it around the house. I've made a few blurred books.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Through lightroom, and they are.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: They're pretty creased up right, because.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: They're in the house, and people use them, and family takes them out and passes them around. And it's just.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So we're so used to books and.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A great way to share your images.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Welcome Steve. Welcome Virginia.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: May have said, Hello, but if not.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Welcome Don Donald Boyd.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: All right.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So I'll just.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Oh, and Mildred says, thanks for the recommended Red River note cards.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Made my 1st couple of note cards, and they came out beautiful, awesome. Well, thank.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That's great, Mildred. Great to hear.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If you are new to the Academy.

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: As far as these sessions, these live sessions. I love the interaction. I love conversation, I love questions.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So you can either leave a question in the chat and.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Hopefully. I will see it. I tend to get pretty zoned in on what I'm talking about, but I.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Really making a strong effort to constantly look at the questions and answer your questions.

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You can also unmute your microphone and.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Just and just talk right.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: As I've said before, I believe that in most.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Zoom on most computers.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The default is, if you press the spacebar as a shortcut, if you press your spacebar that unmutes your mic.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then, when you let the space bar go that mutes your mic again.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But you can always unmute your mic manually. So. Yeah, feel free to ask questions.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And speak up whenever you like. That's the whole point here to.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um have make it a conversation for all of us.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Alright. So I'm going to share my screen and just talk about a few things, and then we'll get into lightroom.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So I guess just the the main thing I want to talk about is, I started with that about I started.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Talking before about the advantages.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Or why make a book? And like I said, it's a tangible thing. It's something you can share.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It is a great way to finalize a project we've been talking about.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Projects, as I said before, and really it is a nice way to kind of bring fruition.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To a project that you really have put time and effort into.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: What you're seeing here is the book that I'm going to.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Show you how to make in Lightroom the book that I've already made. I'm going to recreate it again. But this is.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A book that I.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Made for.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Just a project that I did.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: With images from Death Valley, black and white images in particular, and they had a particular theme, the theme of light and sky.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It just kind of came together. Naturally, it wasn't something that I.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Did um.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Purposefully. It's just after years of visiting Death Valley. I noticed that I had.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This pattern of images.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And we also talked about.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Leaving our work for others, particularly into the future.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I cannot tell you how long Blurbrooks will last in terms of.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The archivalness of a book, but it is closed. It isn't exposed to UV like.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: As often as prints are.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I imagine that you know you're.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: My grandkids will probably be able to look at the books that I produce, and that's something that is just.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Universally easy, to.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um to read, as it were, right.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'm not stuck in a hard drive.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Stuck in lightroom stuck in a system where it may be very difficult for someone in the future.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To be able to get access to my archive of images.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The other thing I want to talk about is that.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Again. This, I want this to motivate you, to create projects because projects are.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: They allow you to focus. As we talked in the last session, they allow you to focus down and deepen your photography. They get a little more focused on what?

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Photography means to you and.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Portfolios and projects like this.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Again. They they give sort of.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Rise to your own voice, if you will.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Even if it's a even if you're moving in very, very small steps.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It's still a step, I think, in a great direction.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um creating one of these books is Ah is, teaches you about curating your work, about creating a.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Sort of a a pattern of images, a grouping of images, a flow of images.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And that will force you to look and and.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Be more analytical and critical about your work.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um. And I just think it's a really great thing to do from a personal standpoint. If photography is something that you really.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Really care about.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: What is the the book? Module in lightroom? Well.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It's up here, and if we go into the book module well, before I go into the book module, let me just explain what it is.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: As I said, lightroom or adobe has integrated.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The blurb service into lightroom. If you want to find out more about blurb and what they are.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You can just go to blurb.com.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And you can make books directly through. Blurb.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Or you can go through lightroom. But this will explain to you a little bit of what the books look like, what the quality of the books are.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You'll be making photo books in lightroom, so you can sort of.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Get a sense of.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The papers that they offer, and etc. And and many of those options will be available in lightroom, not all of them, but many of them will be available in lightroom.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And so this just gives you a sense of.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know what Blurb is all about.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Now before you.

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Think about making a book in lightroom in terms of going into the book module. You want to get yourself.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Prepared. So the way you get yourself prepared is.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You want to have a collection, so that collection is going to be the images that are going to be in the.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In the, in the book.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So if I come down here in my in my collections.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Oops, and I scroll down, and here you can see.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This collection that I've made called Land and Sky.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And that collection has 20 images in it, and these are the images that.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Ah, potentially. I wanted to include in this book.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And so you want to make a collection so you can group all the images together.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That's step number one, step number 2 is.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You can order the images in this collection, so that when you.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Go into the book module. It's easier.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To sort of get a sense of how you want the images or to it's going to be easier for you to add the images to the book in the order that you want.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So it's easier to order them in the.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Library module versus ordering them in the book module.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Remember that to order the books.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In, the.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In the collection. In other words, to create a custom order. You have to come down here.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And change the sort. Order to custom.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Because you can see here that you can choose different types of sorting. So you can sort by capture time, etc. That's usually the way we sort by capture time. Right? So the most recent images at the top or the bottom.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Whatever you prefer. But if you set this to custom.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Then you can move images around any way you want, and it's simply a matter of like, select an image.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And drag it over here and now you can see that it's.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It's I've changed the order.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I'm going to put this image back over here because I've done a basic ordering. Now the ordering of the images. That's something you want to think about.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I want some sort of connection between the images. So I've got the introduction of the book. Let's assume that this is the 1st image in the book.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Then I've got lots of other images that are similar in terms of big cloud shapes.

00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then we start getting into other things, and then there's some water over here. So I got 2 images.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Next to each other that have water in them.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then some other images that.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Sort of continue the steam of water where it looks like. There are waves in these mountains.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then some.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: More close up images if you will, or images that have.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Texturing them. These here where I'm.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A little bit closer to the ground, and then eventually I end the book with.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A panorama, or that's going to be the last image in the book.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And so I have this panorama here.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So you want to set that order.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: As best you can in the.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In the, in the collection in the Library Module.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Now, the next thing you want to do.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That would be helpful is.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: When you add your images to the book.

00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Lightroom can use.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The some of the metadata to add captions to your image.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And so if I select any image here like this 1st one here and I go. Come over here to the right hand side, and I look at metadata.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Let me close this keyword down. You'll see that in Metadata we have a title.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And we have a caption.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You can use either one. I.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Like to use the caption field. You can use the title field if you like.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But whatever you type into this caption field, so let's assume that that's going to be the caption for your image. It can be a title. It can be.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Something descriptive fairly short. This is not a place to put a sentence, but.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I guess you could but a couple of words, or just the name of the image.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Whatever you type in here. That means that lightroom.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Will automatically grab that and place it.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Beneath your image, or.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Wherever you want, but it'll automatically grab that and.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: While you can add captions.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In the book, module.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The captions are only for that book.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Whereas, if you add captions.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To the actual image itself.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Or titles, then.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: They're they're they're in the image's metadata, which means that if you use that image in other books.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The title, and the caption comes along with it.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So I suggest that you add it here. And so I've gone. And added.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Names. And for all these images.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Sometimes I just use the number 1, 2, 3, and 4 at the end of a name, because I can't come up with enough names, but you know.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I call this sky waves, and I've got sky waves 1, 2, 3, and 4. I've got reflections, one reflections, 2. It, you know. You don't have to do this. This is just an option.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But captions, I think, add a little bit more to the actual book.

00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Once you've got those essentially 2 or 3 things done, then you you can go, and you're ready to, I think, more prepared to go into the book module, so create your collection.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: With the images you want. Sort them using the custom order so that they're in. It's easier to add them.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then you can add the title of the caption.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In the metadata area. Here.

00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Alright! So now, when you're ready, then.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Come over to the book module and.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: When you come into the book module you'll see down here. There are.

00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: 3 different views.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And right now we're in the page view. But if I click over here, then we'll now now we're in the sort of the.

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The main view of the book, so we can see all the pages. The multi-page view is what they call it.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This one shows you.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A spread, and this one shows you an individual.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Page, but not of the cover, and I'll talk about that in a minute.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So let me explain a little bit about how.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The book. Module works essentially.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Every book is going to have a cover. So you see this up here. This is the back, and this is the front.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Back front cover, and you can see it's labeled there.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then it's got to have an.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know the the 1st page when you open it right as soon as you open the book. This is the inside.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Of the cover, and then you've got your 1st page here, and then you've got the back.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Cover the back last page, and then the back cover, and that.

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That has to be with every book, right? You can add more pages inside, but you don't have a book unless you've got at least the minimum of the.

00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Cover on the outside and the cover on the inside.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And that's what you automatically get. When you start a new book from here, we can start adding.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Pictures.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Pages.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Now.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You see down here in the film strip.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Here's my collection, and it's remained in the order that I had them.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In the collection. So now, if I wanted to add pictures, I can just start from the left hand side.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And you can see how it makes it easier to add images.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Now up here in the top, right hand side there's a book settings, and this is where you set the.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Overall Um.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Structure of the book, meaning you can select here the size. So, for example, you've got standard landscape.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know standard portrait. They give you sizes here.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Typically, I go with the large landscape. So that's a 13. By 11 you can go 10 by 8, whatever you want. But large landscape.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Is the size that I prefer.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um and.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It'll give you this warning in case you haven't added any pictures. But it'll say you're going to change the book size. That's fine, because we're starting from scratch.

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then the cover. You have an option between.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A hardcover image, where the image that you put in the front is is printed right on the cover, or you have a dust jacket.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I like the hardcover so.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I don't have to deal with the desk, track it, but of course that's a preference you can select.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Then we've got the paper type here.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And you can select different kinds of paper.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Premium, luster, premium, matte proline, uncoated and.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Proline Pearl, photo.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If you want to find out a little bit more about these papers, you can go to the blurb.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Website, and they'll explain a little bit.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To you um.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Explain what the papers are, but you know the quality of the papers.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: They're all very good. I usually go for the.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Premium mat. That's the one that I generally like.

00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I've also used the pro line uncoded, which is really nice as well.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um. But the premium mat is pretty nice.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'm going to select the proline uncoated for now that's just a very sort of smooth paper that's not.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Glossy, but it's not a matte. It's just.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Sort of in between.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Depending on the images that I'm adding, and because I'm adding.

00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Images that I want to have a little more.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I want some depth to them, because they're black and white, and I have to use the same paper for all the images. Right? We're not.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: We don't have the freedom that we have when we're.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Printing individual images.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Then, instead of the premium.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Matte, which I'll use a lot of times for color images. I'm just going to go with Proline uncoded.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then down here there's an option logo page on or off. If you.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Leave this on the last page in the book will have this little blurb.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Logo, and they they give you a discount for that. If you take this off, then the price goes up.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I'm okay with that little.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Icon here.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay. So if I come down to the next tab, the next panel here, auto layout.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And if I click on.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Auto layout. It will.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Basically auto layout the book for me, and it'll select all the images.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In my collection.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And you can see that it added all the images.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay, based on the preset that I had here. So you can see that there's a preset here called left blank.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Write one photo. Now, if I.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Press, command Z. To undo.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I click on the preset. Here I can select another preset that is left blank, right, one photo with photo text.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: One photo per page.

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And you can. You can also.

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Edit the layout, and choose.

00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You can customize this layout. So, for example.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In other words, what we're looking at here are the.

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Presets that lightroom gives you. But if I click on edit auto layout preset.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You can select from many different options.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So, for example, on the left hand side here it says blank. But if I wanted.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Uh.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A fixed layout.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Then I could put one photo on the left.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: One photo on the right, and then here I got options.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Zoom photos to fit.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Or zoom photos to fill.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Remember that when we zoom to fill, just like when we're printing, that's going to crop your image based on the size of the paint of the.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Of the cell of the page.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And, generally speaking, I don't want that, so I'm going to just leave it on zoom to fit, so it'll zoom to fit.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Without cropping the image. Okay, so this is the left side, and then on the right side, you can set the same.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Thing, and you can say save, and I can save this as a preset. So.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Let's say I just say 2 page create.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And now, when I click on auto layout, you see how it laid it out.

00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: With pages on images on both sides.

00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So here's our cover.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then here's our first.st

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Sort of inside jacket, and then.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Every page after that is.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: One image on each side.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This is the auto layout. It works. If you want to do something fast, I never do this. I always.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Customize it, and create my own custom.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Layout. So I'm going to again press Command Z. To undo.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then we'll lay one out, and I'll show you how to lay one out.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To your exactly the way you want it. Custom-wise.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: One other thing to.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Look at? Is that the.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Book module has its own.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Settings. So if you come up here to the.

00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Menu at the top, and you click on book.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You see that there is a book preferences. I'm sorry. That's what I meant. The the book module has its own preferences.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And in the preferences you can.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Select the default.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Photo zoom. And again, remember that.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Zoom to fit.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Is what I prefer, so I don't get anything cropped.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Without. I don't want to crop my images.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then you've got here.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Fill text boxes with caption, metadata, or title Metadata. So remember, before I mentioned that.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You can add a caption.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Or title in those 2 metadata fields, and here you can select as a preference. Of course you can change this, but as a preference you can select.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Whether your captions are going to come from the title.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Metadata, or from the Caption Metadata. So I have this set to caption, because that's where I was.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Entering my my captions.

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: My subcaptions for each image.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: All right and so and constrained captions to tech safe area. That means that.

00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You're not going to get any captions that go very close to the edge of the page, where they look kind of strange, or might even get cut off. It'll keep them.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Within the recommended border that you don't go out of, so that you don't get anything.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Corrupt or cut off by accident.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: When the book gets printed.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So let's um.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Let's start with the cover. So I'm going to.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Double click, and the cover is different from the rest of the.

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Modules or the rest of the pages in the book module, because you can't look at the front of the back by itself.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You always see this? Ah.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This dual page, the front end, the back.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Regardless every page that you look at in.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The book module will have this little yellow. The yellow tells you that you have it highlighted, and this is a little right arrow down here, you click on that.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And it shows you the different.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Covers or not covers the different layouts.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That you can have for the cover. So here's the one that we're using now.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But you can have one. That is.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Something like that where this is, where the image is going to go. This is where the text is going to go.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Or I can change this to.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Something like this, where you've got multiple images. This is another design, so to speak.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So there's many different designs here.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'm going to go with the basic design like this.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And to add an image, you simply.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Drag the image from your film, strip.

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So I'm gonna assuming that I want this image here to be my cover. I'm going to drag this here like this.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And that sets the cover.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Of the book.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Now the way that.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Lightroom works or the book module works, is that.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The book goes inside of a cell.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So think of the cell just like we have a cell when we're printing.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I can move this cell by clicking this little center thing.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I can move it around like this.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Or I can go to the edge.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I can make it smaller or larger.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Like, so.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then right up here, every time you select an image you'll have this zoom.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Which means you can zoom the image in.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If you want to crop the image by default, it's set just to fit as we set it before.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But if you can, but if you click on this, you can actually zoom.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To fill the entire cell.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I don't want to do that, because again, I don't want to crop my image. So I'm going to.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Zoom all the way out, so that we're not cropping the image.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: What I do want to do is, I want to add.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I want to make this a little bit smaller, so that we have some space on the left and the right.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Like so, and then.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In the panels. Here we have different panels to control different attributes of the page.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So, for example, I'm going to jump down to the bottom one here says Background.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If I open up the background you can see that I can set a background color here by checking this.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Box. And if I set the background color.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Now we can select the background color and notice that.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It didn't change, because it's set to white.

00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But if I click on this little color chip here.

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then I select black.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Now we've changed the background of that.

00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Page to black, and we've got our image on top.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Now to add text.

00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To any page.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You can. There's a couple of ways to do that.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If you want something that you can move around and have a lot of.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Option with you. Just right, click, and you can select.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um add photo description. So text that's added to a page.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Is called a photo description.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: We don't want to add a photo. We already have a photo.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: We click on photo description. And now you get.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This text box here, essentially like any other.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Application. I'm going to click inside.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You see my cursor.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I'm just going to type in land on sky.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And it's death Death Valley.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And we don't see anything at the moment, because it's typing in black. So I'm going to.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Triple click that. And you see, it's my text is selected.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then I'm going to come over here. And now come to the text.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Panel uh.

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'm sorry. The type panel.

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Type for working with type and fonts, etc.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And here I'm going to change the color. So I'm going to click on the little chip here.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And change the color to.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Let's say a grayish color.

00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I can drag on the size here.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And make the size a lot bigger.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I can. Right here at the top we have where we select the font that we want to use. And right now the font.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: There isn't any font showing, so I'm going to click here.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And scroll down, and I'm going to find a font. Let's just say myriad.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Pro.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Alright. So that's the font I want to use. And then now we can change the font type. So the font.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Style. So I'm going to go with a bold.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'm going to pull this out a little bit more.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In fact, you can pull this all the way to the edge if you want.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And what that does is that now you can center it.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Because with the text selected.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In this same type field. I can come down to the bottom and select the right. Now it's left justified.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I can click on here and.

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Set it to center justified. And because I.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Expanded the text box completely to the left and the right of the.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Of the page. Now we know that it's centered. Okay.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I'm going to drag this up here like this just to close it up.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then again, if you want to move the text, that's the center.

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: PIN here. It's going to move that down.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Place, that there.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'm going to type again. I'm sorry I'm going to right click again and select, add photo description. You can add more than one.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And here I'm just going to put my name.

00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You can do. You can add whatever you want here by your name, or.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Whatever. Okay? And then I'm going to select everything again.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'm going to select a different font this time.

00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um from a design standpoint. The general sort of guide is that try not to use more than 2 fonts.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Per document or per book.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um more than 2 fonts. It looks a little bit.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It starts to look a little bit.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Sloppy, let's say, or confusing.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You can use more than 2 fonts, maybe 3 fonts at most, but other than that, then it starts to look a little ununified. Let's say.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So I drag this down here. I want this to be a lot smaller. So I'm going to triple click again.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'm going to make the size smaller.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Maybe change the font to not the font, but the font style to be medium.

00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Maybe a little bit smaller.

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That's just me.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Or I can just come in here and type 32. That's a standard number. Okay.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'm also going to add a color to my name.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So here's the character here, the character with the color. I can click on this, and to select an actual color.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I can bring this up here on the right so that you can see colors versus just being.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Monochrome, and then I'm going to select Blue and pull this down again to sort of.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Desaturated. So it's not so.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Something like that. I'm going to select this here at the top. Same thing. I'm going to choose a color.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I'm going to make this sort of a very.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Light.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Sort of warmish color, something like that.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay. Now for the back. I'm going to put the panorama on the back. So I'm going to scroll over to the right here in my.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Film, strip.

00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Put that over here like that.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Once again. I'm going to.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Shrink it down a little bit.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And finally for the spine, which is on the side. You can see the spine right here.

00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You can.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Click in there, and you can start typing.

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You can see my cursor flashing, but again it's in black, so it's hard to see. But I know that I will check to make sure that I typed in the right thing, and then I'm going to hit Tab.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A bunch of times, because I want.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To put my name down towards.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The bottom.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And now I'm going to triple click again to select all that text. You see that I selected everything that I typed out there.

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'll change the color to like a grayish color.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Now you can see it, and maybe.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A I'll set the font again.

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To uh.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Same one we used on the cover.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And that is here, myriad pro. I'll set the.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Make the size a little bit smaller.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then again down here in the.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In, the.

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Left to right justification. We also have.

00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The center justified for the spline. So you notice that when I click on that it.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Put the text in the middle of the spline.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: All right, and that's um.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That's our cover. However, I don't know why this changed.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So this should be my name.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That's weird. So you have to.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You have to just look up for that. Sometimes. The book module can be a little strange where you know it pulls something in. Maybe it pulled in the caption.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But I want it to be my name, all right. So that's our our cover.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Now to get back to looking at the whole book.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: We've got to come over here and click on the multi view here.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Shortcut, for that is control, command, or control. E.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So we got our cover done. Now we just have to.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Fill in the interior pages.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Here's our insight page. I'm going to double click here and now we can see the full page because it's not the cover page anymore. It's not the cover of the book. So we get one page here.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And instead of putting a photo here, I want to put some text.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So I'm going to.

00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Come over here.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.000
jeffreybleaman: Can I ask your question?

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Sure.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:29.000
jeffreybleaman: The spline.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah.

00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:34.000
jeffreybleaman: That obviously, or I would think it would.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:39.000
jeffreybleaman: Its height or thickness, depend on how many pages you have.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:43.000
jeffreybleaman: So how do you? You start out by putting something in there.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:48.000
jeffreybleaman: Maybe, without knowing how thick that's that spine is. Gonna be.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:56.000
jeffreybleaman: Do you just do that as a placeholder, and later on will it grow or narrow as you add pages.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, not not that I'm aware of, which is why, which is why I said it.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: When I double, click the spline, notice that I set it to 15 or 14, let's say 14.

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I keep it pretty small, because if you set it to 28.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And your book is thin. It's going to wrap around the edges, or it's going to get cut off. So.

00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um as far as like.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It growing with the size of your book? I don't think so, so I think I would go with just a smaller size that you unless you're making a.

00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A book with 3 or 4 pages.

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Just set it to something on the smaller side. I don't think you have the kind of control where, if you've got a huge spline.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You can get huge text on the side. Now, I could be wrong about that.

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: For something like that. I would go to to the blurb.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Site and see if there's any information about that. But.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I generally tend to keep it on the small side, and I've never had a problem where it got cut off.

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:46.000
jeffreybleaman: And what did you put on this slide? It's hard to read on our campus.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I just put the same thing land and sky, the same thing on the cover, land and sky actually.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I should have typed in here. I'm going to put land and sky.

00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Comma. Death valley.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then on the bottom. Here's my name.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:59.000
jeffreybleaman: Thank you.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So I just put what's on the on the cover of the book.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.000
jeffreybleaman: Thank you.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So yeah. No worries.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: All right. So I'm going to go back to the.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So we go back to here and.

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Notice that this.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Page already has a photo cell. So the photo cell is what's in gray.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And you can see that I can move this photo cell.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um should be able to move it around. There we go.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay, I don't want to put a photo here. I actually want to put some text.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So with this photo cell selected, I'm going to right. Click and say, remove selected cell.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Because I don't want to put a photo there. I just want to put text. And I'm going to right click and say.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um, add a cell photo description.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So remember, the photo cell is to add an image.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Photo description is to add text.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And so I'm going to move this in the center like this. Make it a little bit bigger.

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I'm going to copy some text that I have already.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Saved from before. So this is just some text about the book itself.

00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I'm going to copy this here.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'm going to come over here and hit paste.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay, and I paste it in some text. This is.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Just some information about the book. My ideas about it.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: My name at the bottom, etcetera.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And if I select all the text I can.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Change the color, make it a little bit darker.

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay, I can again select the.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Style, and so forth. If I want this.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In fact, what I want to do here is.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Pull this down.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'm going to select this top text because this is again the title of the book I'm going to.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Press Command X to cut that. I want to cut that out and just leave this as the.

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Regular text like that. Okay, so that's.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Sort of the what the book is about.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then I'm going to add another.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Photo description, another text cell, as it were.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I'm going to pull this out like this. Make it the same size as the other one.

00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I'm going to paste in there my title and my name.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And this time I'm going to center this. I'm going to come down here to the type.

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Panel again and click on center.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I'm going to increase the size.

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I'm going to select the top text here.

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Make it bold.

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'm going to select the second line here, which is my name, and.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A description, and I'm going to make this a lot smaller.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay? And then there's another control here called baseline, which allows me to lower.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That text something like that.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay, so you're just using.

00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Standard text parameters that you can that are found in any.

00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Text editing software, right? Things like this, font size.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The tracking. For example, let me show you that very quickly. If I come back to the cover.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: One thing I forgot to do that I like to do is if I select this here.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If I select my tile again.

00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I can increase the tracking. And the tracking just basically makes that text.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A little wider. It gives it a nice sort of aesthetic look. Okay, so that's tracking.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I'm going to come back over here.

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'm going to lower this down. Let me make this smaller.

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay. And that's that's my 1st page. When you open the book.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Now we can start adding our.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Images, and the way to do that is, you come up here to the.

00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Page panel, right here, page.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And you say.

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Add a page. Whenever you add a page.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Remember that you're going to get 2 pages because.

00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That's the that's the whole book. You can't have a left page without a right page.

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And.

00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Here we can set the style that we want for each page.

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And just like we did with the cover. You click here on this little dropdown.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And this will show you all the styles that you can do for a page, and there are many, many different styles. So, for example.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: One photo means we're adding one photo per page.

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: 2 photos means we're going to add 2 photos per page. You see the the tech boxes, the photo boxes here.

00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: 3 photos, etc. I tend to go with one photo per page.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then in the one photo per page.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Notice that some of them are the images bleeding. So the image bleeds all the way to the page. Some others.

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: There's a border. Sometimes there's border in a lot of text. Sometimes you see that there's different options here.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And you will notice also that there's a little.

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Circle here, and that little circle. Notice that this one here is.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Is gray. This one here is not, and the reason it's gray is because I clicked on it to add it as a favorite.

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Therefore you don't have to keep searching.

00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Through all these different options. If I click on favorites here.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You'll see that I have my favorite.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Layouts there. Okay. So, for example, if I go to.

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: 2 photo. And I know that I want to use this 2 photo layout a lot. For whatever reason.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I can select the.

00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This little circle there.

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And now, when I go to favorites.

00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You'll see that I've added it to my favorites. Okay.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So these are the ones that I've added as favorites. I'm going to select this one for this image for this page.

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I'm going to come over here, and I'm going to select the same one.

00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: For that page, and then I'm just going to take this 1st image, drag it here.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Take this second image, drag it here.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And now we've filled in our 1st 2 pages of the book, or the 1st 2.

00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Pages with images on them.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Notice that.

00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: When I added these images.

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Down in the film strip.

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: They make the film strip a little bit bigger down in the film strip. There's a little number now above.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Oops! There we go!

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: There's a little number above the image.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And that number tells you how many times you've used that image in the book.

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay. So I've used this image.

00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Once um.

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Over here, but I've used this image twice on the cover and over here, so that.

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Helps you to keep track of which image which images images. You've added.

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And how many times you've added it, and, generally speaking, unless you're adding it like the cover, like I did, or the.

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The back and front cover. You just want there to be a 1. Otherwise you're duplicating your image.

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: All right. So now we can move on.

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Now, as I look at the images in my film strip, I can get a sense of what's coming next. So notice that the next 2 images are kind of the same.

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So I'm going to click on. Add blank.

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And again I'm going to select.

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I added. 2 more here, 2 more pages.

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'm going to select the same.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Layout. Select this one the same favorite layout, and drag.

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: 2 more images, in.

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Like that. Then I've got.

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um.

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'm going to add blank again. So I've added 2 more pages.

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I'm going to again select.

00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This layout. But notice in my film strip. The next image coming up is not a.

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Horizontal. It's a vertical.

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:17.000
Jean-Marie Mayas: Robert, excuse me, can I stop you? I wanna make sure I'm clear on this. Um, the image or.

00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So sure.

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah.

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:24.000
Jean-Marie Mayas: One. Okay, on the top one is the inside front cover. Is that correct?

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You're talking about these numbers here.

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:30.000
Jean-Marie Mayas: Yeah, that the text there is on the inside front cover. Is that correct?

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Not. It's on the inside.

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Of the 1st page. So when I open the book, as soon as you open the book, this is the back of the cover, and this is the 1st page you see.

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: All right. So the back of the front cover.

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Than the 1st page. You see, when I flip this page over, then I'm going to see this.

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Is, that.

00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Does that make sense.

00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.000
Jean-Marie Mayas: The inside front cover is blank.

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yes, that's correct. I'm sorry the inside front cover is here, right? So there's always blank, just like the last page in the book is also not the last page, but yet the last.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.000
Jean-Marie Mayas: Okay. Very good.

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:02.000
Jean-Marie Mayas: Got it.

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Page before you close the book. It's also blank.

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:11.000
Jean-Marie Mayas: Alright, but you could put something there, but in this instance you cannot.

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: No, no, you can't. You cannot put anything here or here.

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:15.000
Jean-Marie Mayas: Okay, got it. Thank you.

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, if if you, that's and that's a good point. If you wanted something here.

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Whatever that might be. Then you can use the dust, cover jacket and the dust cover.

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know, will allow you to, but it would only be this little piece here, not typically what you see, you know, an introduction to the book or something like that. Okay.

00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But if you use a hardcover.

00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Then you cannot put anything on the inside front cover or the inside of the back cover.

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah.

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay. So now I'm going to add, here on this side, I'm going to add a different.

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Format. I'm going to add the.

00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Vertical format. Okay? And.

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Again. It's in my favorites. But if you come to one photo here you can see different vertical formats.

00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Here's 1 that bleeds to the top and the bottom.

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Here's another one that bleeds to the top and the bottom. Here's the one that has.

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A little border top and bottom, and that's the one I'm using as a favorite.

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So now we can take.

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This image. And how do I know which image to go with next? Because it's the next one in my film strip that doesn't have a number in front of it.

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Meaning that I haven't used it yet.

00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Click here and then click here and drag that one like that.

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: All right, and.

00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: We can adjust this, I'll show you how to adjust them. I just want to fill out the book because.

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: We are going to run out of time soon. Okay.

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Now you notice that I have.

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In my film strip I have another vertical coming and another horizontal coming.

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Coming up, next.

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So to speed this up a little bit. What you can do is I'm going to create. I'm going to click on. Add blank.

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So have I got 2 more blank pages.

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'm going to click over. So I want this same layout all right.

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'm going to click here and then hold down the.

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Command and control key. Select both of these like that.

00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then I'm going to right click and say, copy layout.

00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And so that copies this layout.

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Then I'm going to select here.

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I'm going to say paste layout.

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay. And now, you see, I got the same exact layout. So I'm going to.

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Take my vertical.

00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Put it over here, take my next horizontal and put it over here.

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Now let's say that I want the 2 verticals to come back to back. So.

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Instead of from a vertical, I go to a horizontal and then a vertical. Maybe I want the vertical over here very easy to reorder your pages.

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Just select this page.

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then I'm going to hold click.

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Hold and drag.

00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Till it comes on this side.

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And now it's on that side. So that's how easy it is to reorder your pages.

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Move images around. So now in my book, I've got.

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Horizontal to a vertical. Then I continue with another vertical, then back to a horizontal.

00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: All right, then I've got here.

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The same thing.

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So I'm going to right click here and say, paste the layout.

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Because I already had this one copied, and I wanted the same layout again, because, see that I got a horizontal and a vertical again.

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So I'm going to click and drag this one up here.

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Take this one, drag it up there.

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then I'm going to scroll a little bit further down.

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Maybe I'll add a few more, and then we'll finish up.

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um.

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This one here, I'm going to again select my.

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Horizontal image, horizontal layout. I'll do the same over here.

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: We'll add, we'll add this one.

00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And we will add.

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This one.

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And.

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Once again. I'm going to add a blank page.

00:51:54.000 --> 00:52:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I'm going to add 2 more, and that'll be the same layout as before the horizontal and vertical. So I'm just going to do paste layout.

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I'm going to grab here. Put that one there.

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Here's 1 more vertical there.

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then for the last image in the book I actually want to use. I want to add a panorama.

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And the panorama is.

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: All the way at the bottom of my film. Strip at the end. Right over here.

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So if I select.

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This cell, here.

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I'll go into the Dropdown, and you'll see that I've got.

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In addition to a layout that has one photo, 2 photos, 3 photos, 4 or multiple photos. So, for example, you can do stuff like this if.

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You want to lay out 6 or 8 images again, it all depends on what.

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: What you're trying to do. This is more of a.

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Dedicated photography book. But if you, when I do family stuff.

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I might have 6 pictures of.

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know someone in different poses, or what have you? You can be really creative here.

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But you see, you've got here 2 page spreads.

00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And a two-page spread means one image across an entire spread.

00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And so I'm going to.

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This one has a border, and.

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This one doesn't. Let's say I go with the one that.

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Doesn't have that does have the one that does have a little border around it.

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then I'm going to take my panorama and drag it in here like that.

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Again. If I double click, then I can see that.

00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Full spread. Okay? And for this full spread, because it's the last page in the book.

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I also want to.

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Give it a different background, just to kind of signal that it's going to.

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Going to end.

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So I'm gonna come here to.

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: With this page.

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Selected. I'm going to come to background.

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I'm going to open up the background. Tab.

00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I can add a background color.

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To the entire book.

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Or I can add a background color just to this page.

00:53:55.000 --> 00:54:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And up here, you see, there's a checkbox that says, apply background globally. I don't want that. I want to just make this.

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Spread a different color. So I'm going to uncheck that.

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then I'm going to come down here to background color. Select that.

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Nothing changed because it's set to white. But I can come over here and make this black.

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: All right, and that maybe I want.

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Just that last page to have a black background.

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Now these numbers here at the bottom.

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Are the page numbers. Okay?

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Now? Helen asked. Wouldn't 20 pages for a book be a bit small.

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um, yeah, usually I would probably go a little bit bigger than that. I'm just doing 20 pages for this demo. You can add as many pages as you want.

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It all depends what you're trying to do right. If you.

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If you are really, if you feel really strong about a project that has 20 images, and you want to make a book.

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Why not right like there's nothing wrong with that. It it all depends on what you're.

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: What you're trying to do, because you can only make because you're only making one book right? It's not going to be crazy, expensive.

00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: One book like this will probably cost like, maybe.

00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You can get the price up here, maybe 90 bucks something like that. That's not cheap.

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But it's a full bound book, right? That's something that really is impossible to do with commercial printing.

00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You have to order a minimum of 500, let's say, and that's going to be many thousands of dollars, plus you've got.

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: 500 books, so, but you can.

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Do you know, you can add as many as you like.

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: As many. You can do as many pages as you like, I would say no less than.

00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Then perhaps you know.

00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: 16 to 20 images, I think.

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay, so that's our book laid out.

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Now I mentioned the captions.

00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If I double click here.

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: On this image, and.

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You see here that there's an option to add photo text.

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If I click on that. Then you see that I've got.

00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Some text here.

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And this automatically will pull in.

00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The.

00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Caption or the title based on what I set and the way you can do that, or the way you set that is.

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You come over here to the text.

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um.

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Uh, I'm sorry the.

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: See it now. Text.

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Oh, here we go. I'm sorry I was right. You come here to the text.

00:56:15.000 --> 00:56:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Panel and.

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You can see that if I uncheck this, the tech, the photo text goes away. If I select this, it comes back.

00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If I uncheck this, you also have a button here to add it. So it's just the same way to add photo text.

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The difference between.

00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The photo text and the just. When we add.

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know, text like this by adding a photo description is that the photo text moves with the image.

00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So with the photo description. That's what I used to add text on the front and the back covers.

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That's independent. You can put that anywhere you want, but.

00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The photo text moves with the image. It's kind of attached to that image. That's why you can pull in.

00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Things like the metadata. So I'm going to.

00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You see that it says sky waves 4. That's the.

00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The um.

00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Because I'm pulling in the caption so you can pull in different metadata. You can pull in.

00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: For example, the exposure, if you want right, there's the exposure.

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But I don't want the exposure. I want the caption.

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Then you can select this text.

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And you come down to the type area. I'm going to make this about a size.

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: 12. I'm going to give it a color of like gray.

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'm going to select the normal.

00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Font that I was using.

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And.

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: There you go. So it says, sky waves 4. That's the name of the of the image.

00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I'm also going to make it not bold, but just medium.

00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: All right. So there's my little caption.

00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: For my image.

00:57:51.000 --> 00:57:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Now, if I wanted to add oops. Sorry, that's a mistake. Let me go back to the book module.

00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If I wanted to add.

00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Captions to all the images. Well, you could go one by one and add the caption the way I added it here.

00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But there's a much faster way.

00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And what I'm going to do is I'm going to come up here, and if you forget this, just watch the replay. You can watch it again.

00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Come up here to the book.

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Menu, and I'm going to say um.

00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'm sorry the edit menu and I'm going to say, select all photo cells.

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay. And now I've got all photo cells selected.

00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay, I want to add captions to these. Except for.

00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The cover. I don't want a caption on the cover, because that's gonna add a little tiny caption. I don't want that. So I'm going to hold on command and control and deselect.

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The cover and deselect the back cover.

00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So the only thing I have selected now are the actual images that I want to have a caption on.

00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Right. Everything looks good.

00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then, basically, I'm going to come over to.

00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The text here and.

00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Notice carefully now that the only image that has the caption is the one, I added it to.

00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: All the others don't have the caption, but if I turn the photo text off.

00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And turn it back on again.

00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Because they're all selected. Now they all get the photo caption and the photo caption.

00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Is going to be pulling in the metadata that, I added.

00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In the caption field. Okay? And so now you can see when I.

00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Double click, here.

00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Each one will have different names based on.

00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But, I added, and if you want to make some little adjustments, for example, let's say I want this vertical to be a little bit bigger.

00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You can just go in and make this.

00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A little bit bigger, and if I want this one to be.

00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A little bit bigger as well. Same thing.

00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The so-called text, safe area is this line here.

00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So this line here, around.

00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The page is where Blurb recommends you don't place anything.

00:59:56.000 --> 01:00:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Because it may get cut off unless you're doing a full bleed, in which case your image is going to get, you know, a slight.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Cut off on all 4 sides, but that's going to give you a full bleed. Otherwise you don't want the text.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To go beyond that, because then that's unsafe.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Meaning depends on how it gets printed.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay. And so I'm gonna.

01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Keep going through here. Just look at everything else. Everything looks fine. Maybe this will make this a little bigger also.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Of course you can want to move this around. You can offset this if you like.

01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Instead of being in the middle, you can offset it to the side if you want something a little bit.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um stylized.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Uh.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Same thing here.

01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Actually, I'm going to go this way.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Because you can see that the inside of the book is there.

01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: All right, and that.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That is pretty much it. I'm going to go to this one here. I'm going to also move this one to the edge.

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And make it a little bit bigger.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If you come over here to the guides.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Panel. You can also turn on the page grid.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And that gives you a little grid where you can.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Align things and.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It will typically snap.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To the grid, as well.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You can turn on the snap. Here, turn you can right up here, it says Grid Snap. You can.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Have it snap to the cells or snap to the grid. And now, when I move it around, you can see that.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Gives you some more.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Flexibility in terms of how you place things around. If you want a little more control.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'm going to turn this off for now, and turn off the page. Grid.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Right and.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That's basically um.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The whole book. Probably what I did when I made my book was that I came to this.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Not this back cover, because you can't put anything there. But I came to this page here.

01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I added a.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Add page, text.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I pasted something in there.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Some more information, or maybe an about me page, or just some bio information.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You can paste that in there. So.

01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If I uh.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'll just show you that very quickly.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'm just going to grab some.

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Text. Here, come in here.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Hit paste.

01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay. And you can.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You can do that, and then you can come over here and adjust the.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Padding, so that.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Let me make this a little darker. I'm going to select all the text. Come over to the.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Text pane. I'm sorry the type pane and change the color to make it.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Like that, and you can change the font, etc.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I'm going to just.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Leave that like that. Okay, so that would be.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The last page of the book.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then the back cover, and then you're done.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Right? So that's the whole book. Last step.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Very important.

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You want to come up here and click on.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Create, save the book.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You can do this at the beginning. I forgot to do it at the beginning, but you can do it at any point.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: When you click on, create saved book.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You can give it a name, and I'm going to call this.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Book, demo.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: 3, because I did one before already, and I want to put this inside of.

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This collection.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Land and Sky TV. That's the collection that I started with.

01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I'm going to click on create. And now you'll notice here.

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In the collections right over here. Here's my collection, land and sky, and then inside this collection are.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: 2 different books, and each one of these books.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Is laid out differently, slightly, differently, because.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This is the 1st one that I made. You'll notice at the back page.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Is, has a dark background.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And in this book it has a light background, the one we just made now.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If I go to the cover, there's my cover that we made today. And here's my.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Cover that I made before very similar.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But you can have multiple books for a.

01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Collection of images, and you can have multiple books for different collections, right? And the cool thing here is that this book gets saved with the collection. So.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If I go back to the Library Module.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You can see the images that are being used.

01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In that book, or I can see the images that are in the entire collection.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then you'll notice that to the right of the book there's a little arrow.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay? And if I click on that arrow.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It takes me to that book. So.

01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um, very flexible in terms of saving and organizing.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The books and.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Last 2 things I'll show you, and then I think we'll wrap it up for today is.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: When you're ready to send the book to blurb.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You click on the send book to blurb here and up here. It'll tell you what the what the cost is going to be. This says $91.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um.

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Click on, send book to blurb. And the beautiful thing about this is that it prepares all the files.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Gets them in the right resolution, the right.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Color, space, everything. It does it for you.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Uploads everything in one shot.

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You don't have to do anything with exporting nothing. It's an automatic process.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: When you click on, send to Blurb. I believe you get a page that asks you to put in your payment information and.

01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Shipping and all that kind of stuff. Um.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In fact, I'll click it here.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It says, some photos in the book have transparency. That's because the.

01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Panorama. I cropped it in to get rid of some.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Blank space. But I'll click on. Okay. Here. Okay. So here you go. You get.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You create an account. If you don't have an account.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then you sign in, and then it gives you some little options, and then you pay.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: One last thing you can do is you can also export the book as a Pdf.

01:05:57.000 --> 01:06:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So if I come down here to the bottom left and click on export book to Pdf.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Again this transparency thing. Don't worry about that. That just means.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: As I said, I'm cropping in from parts of the image that are transparent.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I click. Ok, I'm going to click on my desktop.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I just select the name, and it will export.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The cover.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And it'll export the.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The actual book itself.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Don says, is there a file size limit per photo, as far as I'm aware? No, because when you export the book and send it to blurb. It's not sending your original 400 megapixel raw file.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It's going to compress it down to an appropriate size.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: For the resolution that they're printing at. So you get good quality.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But I'm certain that it's not sending the your original file. It's sending a.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Compressed version, that is better for transmission and easier for printing, etc.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And finally, if I'm going to go to my desktop here.

01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Pull this over.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: There we go, and um.

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Oh, it went to my desktop. There we go.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Desktop and.

01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: There's the book itself.

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: As a Pdf.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:22.000
Jean-Marie Mayas: Robert, can you add page numbers, pagination at all?

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yes, you can add page numbers.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You can.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Trying to think. Here, remove save custom. Yes, I'm looking for the menu now. It probably is in.

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Here we go. So in the page.

01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Panel. You can see that the page numbers are off.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I can turn those on.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And now, when I come into.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:08:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Here, you'll see a little number one there. Okay, you also have some options in the page.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Panel here, so you can just.

01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Select the location. So, for example, bottom.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Corner. Now it's in the top. In the center.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um. You can put it, you know, top corner.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Like that.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And um.

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You can also set.

01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Which page you want the pagination to start on.

01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So, for example, right now, page one is my intro. But let's say I want page one to be.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The 1st image. Well, I can right click.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: On this page.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I can say, start page number.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And now this one becomes number one.

01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Oops. I didn't mean to do that. I keep going back to the library module. Okay? And you can see that it actually changed the style, but you can go back and.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Adjust the style for thee.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: For the, for the, for the book, page.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In fact, I want this to be.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Bottom, corner.

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And you can also say left and right. So you got, you know you got multiple options there, for where you select the pagination.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So my.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Suggestion is experiment with it. Play with it. You can't damage anything.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um watch, the the.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Watch the session again, in case you want to remember some things that I showed.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: There's also tutorials online and.

01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Adobe has some some decent documentation.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You can change the size of the thumbnails here. So you know, a lot of the things are similar to the other things that we're familiar with in lightroom.

01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: We're just dealing with pages in a book.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: One more thing I'll show you, and then I promise I'll sign off. I forgot.

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Let's come over here to this page. Here, my opening page.

01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You have one more option to add an interesting background.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So if I come over here to background, remember that on the panorama we added a color to the background.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But you can also do 2 things. You can select a.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A graphic.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And these are pre-built graphics. So if I click on well, 1st of all, you make sure you want to make sure that you click on graphic here.

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And make sure you don't have apply background globally on, because that's going to apply this background to every page.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I have that off, but over here there's a little arrow you click on that.

01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And this is, you get some some presets. Right? So this is for photos.

01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This is for travel.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then one for a wedding. So you can imagine someone doing this for a wedding. But if I click on travel.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I select this. Then you get sort of this map.

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Graphic that appears in the back, and I can change the opacity of that.

01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay, so that's kind of cool.

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The other thing you can do as well is, instead of selecting a.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Preset graphic. You can add one of your photos.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So if I just take a photo here.

01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'm going to click. So I'm down in the film strip. I'm going to click and drag this photo and drop it into this cell.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Now it actually added one of my photos as a background. It cropped it. But this is just the background.

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I can also adjust the opacity of that.

01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Background.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And that's something that I had done in the original book and forgot to do here. So another.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Little cool feature to give you.

01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To give the book a little more personality. Let's say.

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: All right, and anything, everything you do is saved right? So there's no saving.

01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: We're working in this book, Demo 3. Because I originally saved it. The 1st time that any adjustment we make is going to be saved to this book.

01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If you need to. If you want to experiment and not lose what you have.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Then what you can do is you can right click on the the book itself right here. Book, Demo.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I called it Demo 3. You can right click and say.

01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Duplicate book, and it'll duplicate the layout of the book.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then you can experiment with that one, and if you don't like it you can always come back to the one you started with. I did that when I was.

01:11:55.000 --> 01:12:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Going to set up the demo for tonight, so that I wouldn't somehow mess up what I had done before.

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Any questions on any of that anyone, any questions, anything that you want to ask before we sign off for today?

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:11.000
Jerry Stachowski: Um, for when you're spanning a page.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, yeah.

01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:16.000
Jerry Stachowski: Um! How how good a result is that, you know. Does it get.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000
Jerry Stachowski: Cropped strange, or something like that.

01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So what do you mean by cropped? Strange? Are you talking about the center.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000
Jerry Stachowski: I, I, yeah.

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: No, it's actually pretty good. So blurred books actually lay pretty like they. They don't have a it's not like a.

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The Hardcover book has a proper.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Binding where you can see the space from the side. So when you open up the book, it kind of lays flat.

01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It's not like one of these paperback books where.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A lot of the image gets lost in the crease. So it's actually pretty good.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
Jerry Stachowski: Ah, okay, thank you. I.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, it's actually, surprisingly, surprisingly good. Yeah.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:56.000
Jerry Stachowski: Yeah, I have a Salgado book from Tashin in it.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So I went.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:00.000
Jerry Stachowski: You know, the center image looks a little odd. There.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:57.000
justinecarson: Yeah.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It does, it does lose, lose a lot, and then in your.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Effort to see the whole thing. You wind up breaking the spine or whatever. Yeah, yeah, no, these are actually, these are actually.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Pretty good. In fact, I should. I have a book upstairs? I should have brought it down to show you that, and maybe I'll show you in the Q&A, but yeah.

01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: They're really, they're they're they're.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I would not be showing you this and going through all this effort if I didn't think it was actually worth making a book, and and.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And good quality.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Do we need to worry about color profiles? No, Mike, that's what I mentioned before, that.

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The nice thing about doing it in lightroom is everything is handled for you. Everything's converted properly.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The colors. I've made 3 color books, and I know someone.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Who's not a member, but someone who's made over 20 books, and the colors are pretty spot on.

01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: They're very, very accurate.

01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Not, you know. They're not going to be like a fine art print on a Hanna Mueller or Kants on paper, but.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000
