00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Welcome everyone. Welcome to another creative path. Academy, live session. This is number.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: 28.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And today we're going to be talking about.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Projects and portfolios.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A very exciting topic for me, one of my favorite things to talk about, because projects and portfolios have been.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A big part of my my own.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Experience my own journey in photography.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And so I hope that I can share some of that with you tonight.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Before we get started. I just want to.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Welcome everyone again, particularly new members. We have a few new members.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Tonight. So I'm excited and grateful about that.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Of course. Um.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Alan! Welcome, Alan! Welcome, Brian.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Carl, Harry Ellen.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Howard. Jean Marie welcome Jerry.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Welcome, Joanne!

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Justine Karen Kerwick.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Karen Comstock, Michelle, Steve, Virginia. Good crowd tonight. So.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Really pleased about that. Hope you're staying cool wherever you are.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In the northeast of.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The Us. I'm in New York. It's pretty steamy here, or has been for a while, but.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It's all good.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If you're new here tonight.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The way these sessions run on. Zoom, it's fairly interactive. I love.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Hearing from you and getting questions and having open discussion. That's the whole point. Here.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Is to make it sort of like a workshop. Experience.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The easiest way is, you can either.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Leave a comment or a question in the chat.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You'll find the chat area in the bottom of the zoom window.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Or you can always use your microphone and just talk, and I'll hear you.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: When you join, you're muted automatically, just to keep things sort of.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Simple at first, st but you can either unmute.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Or, as I've said before, I believe, a shortcut on most computers.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If not all, is press, the spacebar.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And that will unmute you.

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: While you hold it down, and you can use the microphone. And then when you let go of the space bar.

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It'll unmute you again. So that's another.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Easy way. So again I'm I'm always open and free to hear anything you have to say.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um. And so again, that's that's the whole philosophy here in the mindset is to create.

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The most amount of discussion possible, so that we can.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Enjoy everyone's ideas and perspectives.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay, a few new, a few more folks have joined. Welcome, Michelle, Neil! Welcome.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Steve.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Welcome, Tamara. Welcome Virginia!

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Alright. So without further ado, I think I'm going to get started because there is a lot.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To talk about today.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So let's just jump in.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay, so.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: As I said before, working on projects and portfolios. This is.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Something that I am very excited about.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Talking about? Because and I actually.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I can actually promise this a while back. But of course, lots of other topics we've been talking about. So I always had it into my mind.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To talk about projects and portfolios in the Academy. We've hinted at it, and.

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Glanced around it. But I really wanted to give you an overview.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Of projects and portfolios. This won't be an in-depth guide to everything having to do with projects and portfolios, but give you a.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: An overview of the.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The value, the.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The value of working on projects, what what it.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Can help you achieve.

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And also maybe give you some ideas and inspire you to go deeper in these things.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So I'm going to talk about the oops. Sorry.

00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Didn't mean to do that. I'm going to talk about the value of.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Working on projects, portfolios. What I think makes an interesting portfolio.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'll show you some examples of my own projects and portfolios, and then we'll have.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A Q&A at the end, although again feel free to interrupt and ask a question. If you want some clarification on something or.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Have something to share, but I will.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Leave some time at the end, in case.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You want to bring something up.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um. Also.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It would be really ideal. My goal with this is to kind of inspire all of you to think about projects and portfolios, and.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In my mind. It would be amazing if we could actually share your own portfolio. So if you.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If any of you come up with portfolios, and we can work on that.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You can share that with the members. I think that would be an amazing thing to be able to do and look at each other's portfolios, not for a critique, but just.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To see what everyone is doing to get excited about sharing your work.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I think that would be a great thing.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay, so why why work on projects? Well.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Generally speaking, most of us.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Including myself. When I 1st got started. We just went out with our cameras, and we just photographed whatever we thought was interesting.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: We sort of just let our.

00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know our curiosities lead the way, and there's nothing, absolutely nothing wrong with that.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That's a, you know, a good way to approach.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Photography, however.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'm sure all of us have.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Got to the point where we lose our motivation momentum.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You lose a sense of direction.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You're chasing different things in different areas. Or maybe you feel like, you know, you don't really have something that you.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Have been able to go deep in so.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Projects is one of the key things, or one of the best ways to be able to really go deep into.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Something right, some.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Type of thing that you want to explore photographically, and we'll talk about those later.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But again, just as simple things right? It gives you a sense of purpose. If you're working on a project now, you've got some direction. You've got some focus. You're not.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You're not scattered about.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: With different things. You can go deeper on whatever it is you want to work on, and of course you can work on any kind of project. But every time you work on a project you learn a lot about that particular thing that you're working on.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It creates a body of work that.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I think, builds confidence. It builds momentum, it builds a sense of.

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Ownership of your photography, and it gives you. I think you know it makes you feel good that you have something that you can really.

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That you've put time and effort into something that isn't easy. And of course we value things that are difficult because we have to put our time and effort into it.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: As the old saying right, if it was easy, everyone would do it.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And so I think it really helps in all of those areas.

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I would argue that in terms of.

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Creative growth in terms of becoming a better photographer.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I probably can't think of a better thing to do, better activity to do than to work on projects.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In order to improve overall as a photographer.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Again, because you're limiting yourself. We'll talk about creative constraints later. How important they are. You're limiting yourself, and therefore.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You have to go deeper to find solutions versus having.

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Every option available, including one that says, Well, I'm not going to deal with that now. I'll go to something else. If you're working on a project. You don't have that option if you're disciplined about it.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And of course you can start small right? This is not something that should be.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Intimidating it should be fun right? So start small right. Keep it.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Enjoyable and and curious, and stay curious.

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So what kinds of projects can you work on? Well.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This is not an exhaustive list, but just a couple of things that I thought about.

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That I've done myself, and are fairly straightforward.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The 1st one, of course, is a location-based project, right.

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So that means you're going to work on images from a particular location.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That can be local, right? So maybe you go on daily walks every day, or you got some parks in your area. Are you lucky enough to live.

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In a place that has access to beautiful nature. I am so fortunate that I have that I live in the Hudson Valley, and so I'm surrounded by.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Mountains and the Hudson River.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So for me. I've been working on long term projects.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Of the Hudson Valley. So that's.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: One idea, or maybe it's a favorite destination. Maybe you don't live someplace that.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You want to base a project on. But.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You like a particular location. So.

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You love a particular national park, or a place, or what have you? I have those as well. I've been to.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Maine many, many times, and so I've got projects just on Maine, particularly Acadia. I've got projects on the desert from going out West so often.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um. I got projects from.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Other places that I've traveled to regularly. I've been to Vermont many times over the years, and so.

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Every time I go I try to bring back a few images that capture the essence of that location. Right? So that's.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That's a location-based project.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And what's really valuable about that is that.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: When you focus on an area.

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You really get to see it in a way that.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Most other people don't see it or won't see it, because it's just a question of time.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If you go to a national park once, there's no way I shouldn't say no way, but it's going to be very difficult.

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To capture the essence of that location.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: As well as someone who has been there a dozen times or 15 times, and knows the ins and outs and.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Can go a little bit deeper under the surface.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Above the iconic locations. In fact.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: One of the things that I try to do on my workshops is stay away from the iconic locations just because.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It offers a little bit more of a subtlety in the.

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Again the the layers of a location.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So when you learn a place really well, when you dedicate yourself to a location.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I just think you have much more to offer, because you're more familiar familiarity.

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Gives you an easier.

00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Much more easier.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Sense, of.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The characteristics of a place, and then others will say, Wow! I never noticed that before. Well, of course, because maybe you visited once or twice, and this is.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: My backyard, so to speak. It could be a national park that you like to go to over and over again.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Right? So that's a location-based project.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Fairly straightforward, and I think fairly powerful, particularly if you are sharing your work locally.

00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So if you like to share your work locally, maybe you live in a place where.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know, there's galleries, or a photo club, or whatever.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That is a way to.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Motivate you to capture places in a way that others won't see.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Now another type of a.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Project is a theme-based project, and.

00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This can be extremely varied.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And wide, ranging many, many different ways. To approach this many different.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Potential avenues you can take. So.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: For example, one of them is subject right.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Subject can be any number of things right, it can be light.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You can do a project where you're just photographing light and all the different permutations of light.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It can be water, right? It can be an animal. It can be a particular subject. It can be trees, it can be.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Mountains, I mean, you know.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Take your pick right. But the point is that the project is.

00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To capture that particular subject in as many different nuanced ways as possible.

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And that make you have to think about that. You have to.

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Become creative. You have to become resourceful.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In a way that typically if you're just walking around and just photographing whatever catches your fancy, you won't necessarily have to be resourceful because.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Mother Nature is beautiful everywhere, and so you just capture whatever's in front of you.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But if you're going after a particular thing right.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: After you capture, you know.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So many images of still water. Well, what's left.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Well, now you have to try to find other ways to capture water. Maybe you go more intimate. Maybe you go longer lenses. Maybe you go more.

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Macro, maybe you go more abstract. There's many different ways. And and now you can imagine that.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Trying these different techniques.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Forces you now to learn these things and to become more familiar with them and try things that maybe you wouldn't have tried.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Ordinarily because.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: We tend to default, to our normal.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Ways of operating that are comfortable style. Okay, that's another idea.

00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Another approach, maybe black and white, right? Maybe long exposures. Maybe you're working on a project where it's all long exposures doesn't have to be water. It could be anything that's moving.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So it could be clouds that are moving or rustling wind. Maybe wind is a project, and how do you capture wind? Well, of course you have to capture the effects of wind.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You never see wind, but a sandstorm is caused by wind, rustling leaves. Things like that.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That's a project. And you can imagine.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Wow, like, I really have to focus and think about how I would make a project around wind.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: As an example. Now you're going to get resourceful. You're going to get creative, and I guarantee you that if I haven't done a project on wind. You'll have images that.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Most of us won't have, and they'll be interesting.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: An idea in general so.

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um. You know.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Any idea that you have.

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: We've noticed this with documentary photographers. Right? You can capture Sebastian Sebastian Salgado right? Capturing.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Poverty, or poor working conditions or nature. That's an idea. Right? You can think of an idea. Maybe.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Homeless, maybe architecture.

00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Those are subjects, but they're also an idea that can transcend.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: What you might normally think of as just being architecture. Architecture can be anything from an adobe house to a high rise right.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It's all architecture. So that's an idea.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And feeling or mood. Well, that's 1 that I'm particularly fond of, because well, it's difficult.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I enjoy the most challenging things possible. I suppose.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But a project on a feeling or a mood. Right? How do you capture serenity?

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And that's going to be your project.

00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And again we can talk about how long these projects can be, or what have you but.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: For a certain period of time. That's what you're going to focus on.

00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You can imagine that when you go out with your camera.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You're eliminating 70 80% of the up up.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Opportunities, because you're just looking for serenity. But it's not a removal of opportunity. It's an invitation.

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To explore that particular area more. And now you open yourself up to things that again you would have.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Glossed over or glanced over, because.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: There are other things, and you don't need to go deep into one thing, feeling or mood. Those are related.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But again, that's another.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Interesting and very powerful way.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And the key thing here is that when you work on a theme-based project.

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You can imagine. I'm sure you can. You can.

00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: See already that it helps, develop.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Your visual language, right? Everything that we talk about in the Academy in terms of.

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Visual design composition, all those things. Now you have to apply them in a very specific way.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And if you don't know how to do that, or you're unsure, well, you have to go back and learn some more and practice some more, and that really.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Builds up the skills. So it helps develop your visual language. And of course, storytelling. That's.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The central thing to everything we do in the Academy. But.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You can see here, you're telling a story.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And the project or projects.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Help you move along that path.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And give you a sense of growth, or at least progress.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And of course.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You will definitely learn and realize your weaknesses. You will learn where you're deficient and.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That's a great thing. That's a wonderful thing, right? You want to learn from where you are failing.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Because that's either could be a weak point that you're aware of, or it could be a blind spot that you're not aware of, and.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That's how we get better. There are.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I often talk about the 4 levels of competence. Right? The 1st Level is.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: 1st Level is unconscious. Incompetence.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And so that means that you're not even aware that you're making a mistake. You want to go to conscious competence, a conscious incompetence which means.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I know now what I'm doing wrong, and I want to improve it and get better, and that.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I think makes you feel really good.

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay. The next type of project that came to mind right away is.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A gear-based project, and of course.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: These are not isolated. You can combine these in different ways, but just to keep them.

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Simple for now, right uh.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You limit your use of your gear.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That can be a project in and of itself to.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Help you to be more focused, to be more disciplined, to learn your equipment better.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Just like if you are focused on.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A theme-based project that revolves around a particular design. You're going to learn composition a lot better. Well, you'll learn your equipment a lot better.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If you, for example, say on this particular project, I'm only going to use one lens or.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A particular focal length. In the case of a prime lens.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It can be a camera type. We've talked about this before. It could be iphone only where you are now forcing yourself to just use an iphone.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That comes with its particular.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um nuances and subtleties, and you know um.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Ways of using the camera using the iphone or using any smartphone doesn't have to be an iphone. Of course.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That's going to promote a certain way of using.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A camera in this case, a smartphone that you may not.

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Have considered with your regular camera.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:23:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And that will that can inform your regular use of your camera. It's not like you're giving up your.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Dslr, you are just.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Practicing, taking yourself out of your comfort zone, and you can say, Hey, I never.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Tried this before that worked really well.

00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I can go back and apply that technique or apply that way of seeing with my regular camera. And everything is working towards a common goal.

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It could be a format so.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Maybe you want to work vertical only because you feel like vertical is Ah is a format that you're uncomfortable with, or one that you haven't explored fully, or you like.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Other vertical photographs, and yet.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yours don't work as well as you'd like.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Well, that can be a project on itself, right? A square format. You can just work in the square format that forces you to.

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Really focus on the frame to treat composition a little bit differently, because it's a square.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And so your horizon lines and things like that.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Don't have the same effect that they do when they.

00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Horizontal format, because.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: They're not as wide. For example.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You can see how this.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The main benefit. Here it forces you to see.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Differently, and it gets you out of your comfort zone and.

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Particularly when it comes to gear. It builds.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Mastery. Now I'm talking about.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: For the most part. Here I'm talking about projects where you're out in the field with your camera.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You can certainly apply some of these things to working in in editing and post-processing.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I think they're much more effective or much more powerful. When you're again.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Looking at um.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Images making new images. Now you could say.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: For example. Well, I have a backlog of images. How many of them can I make into the square format and see if they work.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That's perfectly fine as well. Right? You can always look at a bunch of images and.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Discover that maybe from a bunch of images that you already have in your catalog, maybe 20 of them actually work in a square format and.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Guess what now, in a square format, they are more appealing to you than they would have been otherwise.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So that's definitely an option, an opportunity.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Another type of project which is near and dear to my heart, particularly here in the Academy, is what I'm going to call a learning.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Based project. And this is a project.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That is designed around.

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Improving a skill.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A technique or an area of knowledge. So.

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: What's different about this from some of the other projects is that in this case you're not really thinking about.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The images themselves, the outcome.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You're just thinking about learning and mastering something. So.

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: For example, in a lot of the one-on-one sessions that I've done coaching sessions that I've done with.

00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Many students over the years.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I look at their images, and one of the things that I.

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: We'll give them an exercise for is photographing light because.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I find it's very common.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The awareness of light is not as.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Heightened or as strong as it can be. So, for example, I'll say.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um, we're going to meet in 2 weeks for the next 2 weeks, or next time. Next 2 times you go out, I just want you to photograph side light, only.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So every image that you make has to be made with side light.

00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Or backlight, for example. And after we've done this for a couple of months.

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Well, you really develop a sense of.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And an awareness of direction, of light. You're no longer guessing where the light is, you.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Just kind of get a sense of where the light is. You develop this 6th sense. And then people say, Wow, how did you.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know. How do you? How are you so aware of that? Well, you practiced it right.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: As I mentioned before.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In, the.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Formats. Right? You can reorder.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Re-edit. I'm sorry we can. You can re-edit older images to experiment with.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: New ideas and skills. Right? So maybe you're learning new things about lightroom new ways to use masking. What have you.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Well, maybe set aside some time work on a project where you're going to go back and re-edit a bunch of old images and see if that.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If those images become a a new group.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That have this new editing technique, and maybe you take them to a different level, or you.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Interpret them in a way that you weren't able to before, or in a way that you weren't even aware you could.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Compositional technique as well.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: For example, another exercise that I will give.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Coaching students is.

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um go out on a.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know, a couple of days, or what have you? And just to make images that have strong leading lines.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: What happens then is that.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You start looking for leading lines everywhere. After a while you start to see them easier.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: They become intuitive. It's like it's like any other skill that you practice.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know, a concert violinist doesn't just go out and start practicing, you know Chopin, or whatever a pianist.

00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: They have to learn with the scales they have to practice their scales, they have to practice.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The small.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Ah skills that then they can put together.

00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And use them all in a full piece.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um, you know, in sports.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:28:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: They rarely, actually, when they practice, you would rarely see them playing a game when they're practicing. They're practicing individual skills than they put together in a game and the same thing here, right.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Maybe practicing, just photographing texture.

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Maybe just photographing color.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And that can be a project in and of itself. You never know what's going to where it's going to lead, but at the very least.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It's something that you are now.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Becoming more aware of.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Maybe practice one principle right? We've talked about the principles of design.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Patterns, shapes or tonality.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Maybe. Just say I'm just going to go out and try to for the next month. I'm just going to work on photographing patterns now.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Again. You may think that wow! Whole month photographing patterns, but.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A month goes by immediately, and that's 1 thing that you can.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Feel you gain some, some knowledge on.

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: After you learn that skill, you can start building up more skills.

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So forth and so on. So these are learning based projects that I think.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Are very useful. In fact.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: As I was putting this presentation together.

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: One of the things that I was inspired to do is.

00:28:56.000 --> 00:29:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: From now on, when we do a and maybe I'll go back and do some of the older ones. But on our live sessions and future live sessions, where.

00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I talk about a technique or a skill, I'll actually, I'm going to put an exercise in the.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: On the post on the website, where, if you want to practice that, here's an exercise you can use to sort of help you along the way.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then that'll give you some ideas based on this sort of learning-based project.

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Idea.

00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So you'll notice that all of these.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Projects. All of these.

00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Ideas for projects are another, are a form of.

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Creative constraints. Creative constraints are, you're basically limiting yourself.

00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know, in today's world. There's this idea, this meme, whatever you want to call it, that.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Creative limitations are bad. You want.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Unlimited creative potential. You want.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: All of the creative options available to you, so that you can make choices.

00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The problem is is that there is something called paralysis analysis. There's something called.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um, you know, mission scope where you basically just get diluted amongst all of the different options that you can try.

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You never really commit to anything.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And the more choices you have, the harder it is to make a decision to sort of decide.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Which direction you should go in.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Limiting yourself.

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Imposing limits on yourself.

00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Artificially, sometimes.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You don't have those artificial limits. We've all been there where we only had a particular piece of gear, one lens, because that's all we could afford, and.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Guess what it never really held us back. If anything.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It. Let us use that lens in more creative ways. But we.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Have riches of abundance. We all have multiple lenses, lots of gear, lots of many things.

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I think that does create a it dilutes your sort of focus if you want to focus and and really go deep on something.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The the freedom you get freedom when you limit yourself, because now you're free.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To make less decisions and focus more on.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Exploiting the opportunities there.

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So creative constraints right on location.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: On theme, on gear, on the story.

00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Maybe a conceptual, maybe a visual right? These are all the types of projects we've been talking about. But they're basically a way of limiting yourself to just a few choices, and then.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Exploring that right. I love this quote by TS. Eliot, when forced to work within a strict framework.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The imagination is taxed to its utmost right. That's what I've been talking about. You have to really think deeply, and will produce its richest ideas.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Given total freedom, the work is likely to.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Sprawl, and I've I've been there as well where I had just.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Any choice imaginable to make and.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Nothing really came of it. So.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I hope that you take this idea of creative, creative constraints, constraints on board.

00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Even if you have to resist.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The marketing efforts of all the companies out there who want you to buy more stuff and more stuff and.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Have more opportunities. It really is when you limit yourself. This could be software.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This could be with projects as we're talking about here.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But I really think it does create a sense of.

00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Momentum and depth in your work that it's hard to get otherwise.

00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay, so let's switch over to portfolios now. So what are.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Portfolios. How are they different?

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: From projects. And actually, before I.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Do that. Does anybody have any questions on projects, anything I've talked about in projects before.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I move on to portfolios. I mean, they're connected, of course, but anything with projects or anything, anything anybody anyone wants to add to what I've said so far.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.000
steve guercia: Rob in in terms of pitch, picking a topic or a scope.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:49.000
steve guercia: For a project, any suggestions on.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:55.000
steve guercia: How you determine if you're picking something too narrow or too broad.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.000
steve guercia: So, for example, one of the things I've been toying with.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:05.000
steve guercia: Is doing a project of old.

00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:13.000
steve guercia: Towns in New Hampshire, specifically old town halls, general stores, churches.

00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:16.000
steve guercia: How do you make that.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:19.000
steve guercia: Judgment. Is it too narrow, or is it too big?

00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um. So as you're asking me this question, I'm thinking in my mind, I'm thinking of a scenario. That's a great question. I'm thinking of a scenario where.

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Your scope would be too narrow.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I'm having a hard time coming up with one.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So I would say that.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It's almost.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It's very, very difficult to go too narrow. Right? If you let's say you want to just photograph bees.

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The insect. Okay, that's it.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You might think. Oh, my God, that's so narrow! And yet.

00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'm sure that no one would be surprised to come across a portfolio of.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Bees with amazing images in all different.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know, permutations of the idea of how to capture a bee, because then you can start thinking about well.

00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know it can capture it in flight. You can capture it with camouflage. You can capture the anatomy, you can capture the I mean.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You see what I mean. So there's almost no limit.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I guess if you went small enough you'd need some kind of microscope right? If you went to a small insect that you couldn't see.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But once you got a macro, you know, camera that could go microscopic, then your options are open again. So honestly.

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um, Steve, I don't think you can go too narrow. I mean.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If you've got. If you have.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Time, and you've got the dedication. And here's the key thing. I think.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Maybe this is what you're asking. If you are.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um curious enough about it, right? If you're.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If you're really curious about it, someone that just photographs bees, it's someone I'm assuming that just.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Is really into bees, or really into cars. For example.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And so I don't think you can go too narrow. I think it's a question of.

00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: How much time you want to put into it. How excited you are if you're excited about it, if you, if you love that kind of thing.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I don't think you can go too narrow now. You can go too wide.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: For the opposite reason. Right, if you go.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Wide enough where you're not specific. Then again, you're just sort of if you just say.

00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I mean, you could say architecture, but that's a very, very wide scope.

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Maybe you can limit it to certain types of architecture.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So I.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I would say, whatever it is that excites you, that you find visually appealing that you think you would.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Enjoy photographing for a little while. If your project is a couple of weeks or a couple of months.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Doesn't matter how narrow it is. Go for it.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Anybody else.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Harry. Yeah, there are some there are. Harry says there are some.

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Photography books that have projects after each chapter. Yeah, exactly right. Sure.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um, if you're reading a book that's showing you different or explaining different concepts. Yeah, there'll be a make a project on that concept. That's the learning-based project that I talked about before.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay, so a portfolio. What is a portfolio? Well, a portfolio? If if the project is the.

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The actual capture of all these images in a particular.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Category, theme, etc.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Then a portfolio is a natural offshoot of a project. It doesn't have to be an offshoot. You don't have to make a portfolio from your project. But basically, the portfolio is.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The images, curated images from that project.

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That now basically have some cohesive connection between them that represents.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The results of your project. Okay?

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um, not necessarily.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Just the best images, but the ones that work together so.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A single image, of course, is just. Hey, here's my best image.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Whereas if you have a portfolio, you want all the images to work together to tell a story, to have a connection or.

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Another way of thinking about it is that the images have a conversation.

00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So it's not if you have 8 images in a portfolio, and 5 or 6 are really.

00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You think good, strong. Let's let's use that word.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then the last 2 are weak.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Maybe they don't connect properly. Maybe there's not a.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Theme that flows through them as well as it could.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That's not going to be as strong as a portfolio as maybe.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: 8 images that individually, maybe they aren't your best work ever.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But together they work together to be greater than the.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Than the sum of the parts, as they say.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So it tells a story. It expresses a vision.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And the portfolio.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: We'll talk about how you would use a portfolio like. Why, you would want to make a portfolio.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It's not just or.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Don't think about it as oh, I'm going to be selling my work or.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Trying to get into a gallery or anything like that. It could be for yourself only, but.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The important thing is that it develops your creative vision, because now you have to.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Go from that project, or for that group of images.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And cull the images out. You have to.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Make decisions and think about how the images work together. So it develops your vision because you have to think carefully about how the images connect together.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Builds confidence for sure.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If you can go through the process of building a portfolio that you feel represents your work at this current time.

00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And that's a key thing, right like.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Don't build a portfolio or make a portfolio. Think about it as, oh, this is comparing to someone who's.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Been doing it for 30 years. This is your portfolio right now for yourself.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And your portfolio, portfolios.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Will grow over time. They'll evolve over time. I have portfolios from 10 years ago.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I don't think they're as good as the ones I have made in later years.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I still enjoyed the process, and I still think they were necessary.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To be able to make others along the way. Right? It's all a stepping, a stepping, a process of stepping stones, etc.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Portfolios are useful for websites. So if you want to create your own website, or you have a website, right? That's.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You can think about portfolios that way. Make a portfolio of different.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Themes, or whatever you've worked on in your projects.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You can. Let's say that you'd like to show your work in a local gallery right.

00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Small gallery in your town that you think.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You would like to be able to display your work. Well, that's a nice way of.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Approaching the gallery is by creating a portfolio, because it shows.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Dedication. It shows you're serious. It shows you've.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Thought through the process of creating a.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Cohesive body of work. You can make a book.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um not a I mean, you could certainly make a.

00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Published book for sale, but you can also make a book for yourself.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In fact, we're going to be talking about that soon with the blurred books from lightroom right right in lightroom.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Lightroom classic. There is a book module.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And it allows you to create a book.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And it's a beautiful way of creating.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A nice presentation of your work.

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And it's also good for feedback. Right? Let's say you want to have someone look at your work.

00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And give you and evaluate your work.

00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It's 1 thing to evaluate an image.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Have someone evaluate one of your images or 2 or 3. It's another thing to give them a portfolio. Let's say 15 images.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And ask someone to give you some feedback, because.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: From my own experience when I've.

00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Given others feedback on their portfolios.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I don't look at the 1st image and immediately start giving them feedback. I have to go through all 15 images, because that.

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Tells me a sense of what the photographer is thinking and how they're connecting the images.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It's like one of my favorite analogies. Is is an album right? A.

00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A musical album. Right? You don't listen to the 1st song and make a decision about the album. You listen to the whole thing.

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And albums are put together in a very.

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Particular way in a very careful way, so that the 1st song kind of gets the theme going.

00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The middle of the album as a way of growing. And then, you, you know, in the old days we'd flip the record over, and then.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Side B would be the continuation of the story. Now it's a CD or.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: An album in spotify. What have you? But still they're ordered in a particular way. They take you on a journey at least the very best albums.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I look at a photographer's portfolio.

00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: All the way through the last image, and then I'll go back and.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Think about, and what I can say to help them in terms of.

00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: How my.

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: How I resonated with.

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Not only each image, but the flow of images.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Maybe one image was.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A little bit weaker, but then it led to something that was stronger, and I could see the connection. So I hope you see there that a portfolio or group of images.

00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Is a little bit different, a more expansive view, a more, I think, a better sense of.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A photographer's.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A place in terms of how developed they are versus one particular image, because we can all get lucky once and make a great image.

00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But the question is.

00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Can we make a body of work.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So portfolio ideas you can make.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Ah! What I'm going to call general.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Best of portfolios. Right? So these are just your best images.

00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That could be for your website. You can always divide up your website into different categories. But these are going to be your best images. Right? That's a.

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Portfolio of my best work.

00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: As I said before, this could be.

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To try to get into a gallery.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: For website galleries. I'm sorry.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Instead of just one portfolio, you can have 3 or 4.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Portfolios for your website. Maybe one of.

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know, landscapes one of Rivers, one of I mean for mine. I'm so I'll give you my example. Mine. I've divided mine into, you know.

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Forests. I have.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Lakes and rivers. I have mountains, I have deserts.

00:42:55.000 --> 00:43:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Those are the different portfolios that I have on my website that give a general sense of what you're going to find in that portfolio.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Again, you can always make these. Another way is to make them for growth right?

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You can make project-based portfolios. So that means, if you engage in one of these projects that we talked about before, then.

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That can lead to a portfolio. Okay.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You've photographed barns or stores, or whatever have you.

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You've got a couple 100 images.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Now you make a portfolio of 1015, 20 barns, or image of stores or storefronts.

00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That tell a story of.

00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know, stores and their owners, and.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The towns they're in, and so forth, and.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um. You can imagine that if you think the subject is too narrow. But now you make a portfolio of 10 images. You're going to have a story there. You're going to have a theme if you.

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know, if you put some time and effort into thinking about the flow.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You can also make audience specific portfolios.

00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So again, this would be submitting to a gallery. Maybe the gallery is looking for images of a location.

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I've done many of these right we want. We're doing a Hudson Valley show.

00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Can you submit some images? So I put together a portfolio of Hudson Valley images.

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Or you know Acadia or Moab, or what have you.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It could be a photo contest. It can be.

00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A personal legacy. So this is another one that I've been working on, which is.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um. What do I want to leave my kids with in terms of images? Right? Of course.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: They're going to have access to all of my images. But.

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It's not enough just to give them a hard drive. It'd be nice if I could leave them.

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A couple of portfolios, particularly.

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And most importantly for me, not of my landscapes.

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I want to give them a portfolio of how I've captured them growing up, my kids, particularly how they've grown up over the years.

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So that they can look back and say, Wow! Like.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know, our dad left this for us, and here is us growing up and family activities, etc. So that's another amazing way.

00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To think about a portfolio.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That isn't just about my work. It's really.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: About them, and seeing them grow up in all the times.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And experiences that we've had together.

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So again, building a portfolio right.

00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You can do this from existing images as well. So it's not like you have to start making new images.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This is a very good way to go back and look at your current library, instead of just looking at 40,000 images in just one big pile.

00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Start to break them down, start to look at them.

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Review your library right with fresh eyes, look for themes, look for things in your images that.

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Create in your library, in your catalog.

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That create themes or visual unity.

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You've captured images for many, many years.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I am absolutely sure there are themes there that perhaps you haven't explored, because you just haven't thought about it. And you said, Well, that one image.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Wasn't that great? But you may have a whole string of those images from different times, and put together into a portfolio. It becomes much more interesting.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You can use lightroom collections for this. This is a.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Amazing way to use collections. I'll show you an example in a moment.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Collections are a great way to play with this, because collections allow you to make virtual folders, you can drop images.

00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: From anywhere into multiple collections. They're all non-destructive, great way to come up with.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To store.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Your projects and your portfolios.

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You can ask for feedback, and that's another great way to make a portfolio.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And finally in terms of numbers.

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: While a project is generally going to be time-based, I would say, right. You work in a project for.

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Month, a week, 3 months, 6 months.

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Maybe you work on a project for.

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: 20 years, like I have in terms of the Hudson Valley, because I'm just capturing for the Hudson Valley. But when I make portfolios.

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And limit them to a certain number of images. 1015 images per portfolio. A 30 image portfolio really isn't.

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It's like a 30 song album. I mean, they exist, but for the most part it's almost too much.

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: For the viewer.

00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To get a sense of what you're trying to say.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So let me jump into lightroom very quickly here, and I'll give you some examples of.

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Some projects. I have many projects scattered in many different places, but I'll show you some examples here, so I've got.

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A um.

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A folder here called Projects.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'm sorry, Folder. A collection called Projects. Very sorry. That's it.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Totally wrong collection here.

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And inside this collection is actually a collection set.

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Inside this collection set. I've got various collections. So here's 1 called.

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um Hudson River and.

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This project.

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: One of my long, long term projects is all my images of the Hudson River.

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Mostly within about an hour of where I live, north and south.

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And it has. This has, you know, all my Hudson River images.

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I've got them rated and keyworded, etc. They break down into.

00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Smaller type.

00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Groupings, for example, winter.

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Fall, Summer, etc.

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But this is all Hudson River, and then, if I go into the ratings here, I can.

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Call these down to the best of the best.

00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: From my opinion, and then this could be something that I could then turn into a.

00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Portfolio if I needed to. So these are.

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The the best of that.

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Of that project.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I have another project here that I did recently called Hudson Yards. So when I was down in Build Expo just a couple of weeks ago.

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In New York City. I was in New York City.

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: For 3 days, and all 3 days was incredibly foggy, and the 1st day I walked out I looked up into the sky.

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And there was this incredible fog hanging over these buildings. And I just thought, you know what I'm just going to photograph this fog for the whole time that I'm here, because.

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Why not? And so I walked around every morning and just made pictures.

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Of with the theme of fog and architecture, or fog and buildings, and that became just its own project that I worked on for 3 days.

00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then I then decided to convert them to black and white.

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And and limit them, or cull them down to.

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: These 10 images that I could potentially print and make into some kind of a collection or portfolio.

00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um, and so.

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That went from a project a very quick and off the cuff project. But the important thing there.

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Was that for those 3 days I just wasn't walking around aimlessly. I basically walked around looking up all the time.

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And it had a direction it had a purpose. By the second and 3rd day I was excited to go out.

00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And not look at the river, or cars, or or anything.

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I saw the fog, and I just tried to find better ways to photograph the fog better angles.

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I started to see.

00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A little bit better, even just, you know, a percentage or 2, whatever it is right. But I started to.

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Notice things that I wouldn't have noticed the 1st day, and I certainly wouldn't have noticed it if if I just went out.

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: With my camera, and just sort of willy-nilly captured everything that I saw.

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'll answer your question in one moment, Tamara. Just let me get through this, and then I'll answer your question.

00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um! Here's another project called.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Land and Sky Death Valley. So this wasn't a project that I worked on.

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It wasn't premeditated.

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This was just all my images from Death Valley.

00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That I've shot over 4 or 5.

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Or 6 visits. Now, one day I went through them, and I started thinking about.

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I started just looking at them and trying to notice patterns trying to notice themes. And one thing I noticed was a lot of.

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Clouds and skies. And that's just something that.

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Stood out to me like, Wow, I really enjoyed doing that photographing clouds and sky.

00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I converted them to black and white to make them a little more abstract, and then.

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I cold them down to about.

00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: 8 or 10 images. And that's what you see here. So these are the 10 final images.

00:50:55.000 --> 00:51:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And the theme here is land and sky. That's what I wound up naming it. So it's basically how the sky and the land are interacting with each other.

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And each of these images has.

00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A sense of that.

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Natural sort of connection.

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That idea of land and sky.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Here's another project called Seascapes. This is, instead of a 3 day project like the New York one. This is a longstanding project. I love seascapes. I love capturing the ocean.

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So all my images here are seascapes. I generally tend to.

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Group these by using keywords. So every time I go out.

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I photograph seascapes. I'll keyword them with the keyword seascape in lightroom.

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then I'll eventually create a collection of all the skiscapes seascapes. And then, if I decide that I want to, let's say there's a gallery show somewhere, and they say, Hey.

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Do you have any seascapes, or we're doing a new show? We're going to be featuring seascapes. Do you have any images? I can come here.

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Pull up my seascape project, and then I can again.

00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Call them down to 4 images, or greater.

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Which is for me like I feel images that I would share, that I would.

00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Put into a gallery, or etc.

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: All right. So that's another.

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Project here, and I've got many other projects in different places.

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But many of the projects have been discovered projects. So by that, I mean is that you've got.

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Thousands of images.

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Are there any connections? Are there any themes? Are there any similarities? Are there any patterns that you notice in what you're photographing.

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And you'd be surprised right in the things that you resonate with.

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I've discovered this now over time, you know I love trees.

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I love seascapes. I love water, I love clouds, I love light.

00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So those are themes for me that I try to.

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Leverage, because it become.

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'm more excited about them, less excited.

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Let's say about architecture, even though I love that as well. But.

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Architecture might be the thing that really excites you. Where you get into a flow state.

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Flow state means you just have no track of time.

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If I'm on the ocean I can be there.

00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know all day without noticing.

00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And maybe for you. That's something else. That's what you want to look for.

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Where you're really excited about.

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A particular topic.

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay, Tamara. Hi, Robert, when it comes to website design, can you please explain the difference between the use of portfolios and galleries for displaying one's work. Is there a distinct difference between the 2? I've often seen them used interchangeably, and I'm not.

00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Sure they should be.

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um, that's a great question. I would say that there.

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: They can be used interchangeably.

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So you know.

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You can have if you have a website and you have 5 galleries.

00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The gallery would be a categorization of images.

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I would say.

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I guess I guess a portfolio.

00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Wouldn't apply if your gallery had 50 images in it, right? Because you wouldn't have a 50 image portfolio.

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um. Perhaps I was thinking about.

00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Portfolio in a broader sense, so.

00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You want to put your portfolio of images.

00:53:55.000 --> 00:54:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: On your website, and maybe you can, you maybe you want to break it down into 10 or 15 images. That's fine. I so for example, for me, when I 1st started my website.

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I think I started with maybe 200 images that I put on my website.

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I broke them down into.

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Smaller and smaller groupings.

00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Because it was easy for.

00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Me to do that. It was the, I think it presented a a more interesting.

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Experience for the user, for the viewer.

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But they were all connected, so I didn't have.

00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Water trees, buildings, barns, and cars, because.

00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: My scope was limited to landscapes.

00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And so they would just be in the landscape category.

00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Deserts, water.

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Seascapes, trees, forest.

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Etc. Um.

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So yeah, they they can be interchangeable. I guess I'm just thinking more in terms of, or my.

00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Idea here was more in terms of.

00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You work on a project, you develop a portfolio from it. And now you can share that online and.

00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You can decide how many images you want to share. But if you've got a website with.

00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: 5 galleries. Okay? And each gallery has 10 images.

00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That's 50 images, you know. That's perfectly fine. There's no.

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Minimum or maximum number. I would rather.

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Think about quality over quantity.

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay, so again, examples are portfolios.

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: These are just some examples of how I've.

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Manifested portfolios. I showed you the land and sky portfolio.

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And this is just a contact sheet that I made in lightroom.

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And this is the what I actually did with it. I actually printed out.

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Each image 8 and a half by 11.

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: 10 images, and then I put them inside this folder called a folio. They they're really hard to find now.

00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But I have a bunch left over when I bought them, and then that makes a simple portfolio that I carry with me whenever I go to a.

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Convention, or show whatever.

00:55:54.000 --> 00:56:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This one is fairly new, so I only took this with me to New York a couple weeks ago. But I've done this in the past.

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This type of portfolio where you've got 10 loose prints.

00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In a package, but someone can open it up and look at the images.

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This has been very.

00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Fruitful for me.

00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Meaning that, for example, my.

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Association with Kensun.

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Came about because of one of these portfolios.

00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Because I took one with me when I went to a photo convention 12 years ago.

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I went to the booth, and I said, Hey, I actually used your paper to make this portfolio. Would you like to take a look at it, or give me some ideas about how I can use the paper better.

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: They liked what they saw, they liked.

00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That I actually took the initiative to make a portfolio. They asked me if they could hold on to the portfolio, and I.

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I reluctantly said Yes, and.

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Next thing you know, I've been an ambassador for them for 12 years.

00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I've gotten into galleries with portfolios like this. I've gotten sponsorships. I've gotten offers for many different things again.

00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Because you are showing that you're dedicated. Not just.

00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know you're standing out above.

00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The normal thing.

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Please do not share a portfolio that you have.

00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In a binder with plastic sleeves, and you've got the pictures inside of the plastic sleeves.

00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: No one's. Most people are not going to take the time to take them out of the plastic sleeve to actually see the image.

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So you really want to show your care, and using a beautiful paper like this.

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: As we know from our talk about printing, really makes an impression.

00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Here's another!

00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Portfolio. This one is called the Winterscapes. So this is just winter images from the Hudson Valley. I've used this in.

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Gallery shows, and things like that. But again.

00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: These are just images that convey the sense of winter.

00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In the Hudson Valley. So a very specific thing, location based and idea based.

00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then I've used this again for different presentations and shows, etc.

00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Here's another one that I did many years ago called textures.

00:57:57.000 --> 00:58:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I called it textures volume one, because I have volume 2, 3, 4. But these are prints that I made. The idea here was to try to make images, that.

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Were, had a connection through texture.

00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I think when I finished this project there were some that I wound up taking out.

00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So, for I don't remember now exactly. Maybe.

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This one here I may have taken out.

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Because it didn't. But this was the initial idea. So when I 1st put these images together, this was my.

00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Proposal, and then I, you know, asked my wife to give me a helping hand, and.

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: We narrowed it down to 8 or 10 majors.

00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Here's 1.

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Another portfolio, so to speak.

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Of note cards. So I make a lot of note cards. I have different sets of note cards. This one is called Landscapes, volume one.

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I have a volume 2 and a volume 3. There are 10 images each.

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I have Hudson Valley note cards, but again it requires me to get.

00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: 10 images together that can be in a package, that when someone opens them they can see the connection.

00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In the note card set, and these are really useful.

00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You don't have to make note cards to sell. They make amazing. Thank you. Cards. They make amazing.

00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Gratitude. Cards you send them to your family and friends.

00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: They will never forget. They'll be asking you for more.

00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Speaking of. Thank you. Cards. This is another idea. So these are not. Note cards in terms of foldable note cards.

00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: These are simply photo cards.

00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um. So I would basically print 2 of these on one sheet of paper and cut it in half.

00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I would use these for, thank you, notes or gratitude things. I would put them inside an envelope.

00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Mail them to somebody on one side would be a panoramic image.

00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I would have some information here in the picture, maybe a little bit of.

00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Story of the image, and my.

00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um branding logo down here which has changed. But this is what I was using years ago.

00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I would put this in an envelope, and I can't tell you how many times I got.

00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Feedback and responses. From this.

00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I tried to get into a pretty.

00:59:56.000 --> 00:59:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Pretty high profile, gallery, show.

00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Many years ago, and they didn't accept.

01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: My images, I was rejected, so to speak.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So I took one of these.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Cards, and I sent it as a thank you, to the gallery curator and say, Well, I appreciate you. Looking at my images.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'll try again next time. Well.

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: 3 weeks later one of the.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Photographers who had been accepted, canceled out, or backed out? Or what have you.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And she called me, and the reason she said she called me was because.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Her. My card was so much more impressive than all the others that she had it out on her desk and.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: When they needed someone to take the other person's place.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um! She thought of me first.st So again, these are ideas, and these photo cards again, were like 10 or 12 images.

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Or panoramas. We're talking about a.

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A that's a format-based project.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um. I like making panoramas, and whenever I have an opportunity I add them to my panorama.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Project, etcetera.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And one last one is calendars. I used to make calendars for a long time. I stopped a couple years ago. I think Covid.

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But a calendar is another way to make a portfolio. Right? You.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That's a project and a portfolio. You spend the year making images. And then, at the end of the year.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You put them together and you have them printed. It wasn't that expensive? If you're not making too many.

01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: These days you can actually make home printed calendars. That's again, just another idea.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: For thinking in terms of groupings, of images.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Projects and portfolios.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Karen Kerwick: Robert.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yes.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Karen Kerwick: Are the photo cards, a canceling product.

01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yes, so.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The um.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Photo cards that I showed you.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I showed you. Note cards. Those are the ones that are foldable. Those are not Canson. Canson does not make foldable note cards. Those I get from.

01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Moab, but you can also get them from Red River, so they have a little score, and you fold them over.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The photo cards. You can use any paper for that, because all I was doing was.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Using an 8 and a half by 11 sheet.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I would lay out 2 of those cards on one sheet.

01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Print it out, cut it in half. That was it so.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: There was nothing foldable, but it was just the front and the back of the card. I would write.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Something on the back and the front of the card had the print with the information.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Karen Kerwick: Is that a a photo paper that you printed on and then cut in half or.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, no, no. I mean, it was sure. Yeah, I wanted the front to look as good as possible. So it was a Cantson photo paper. I think I was using rag Photographiq or No. Actually, I was using.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.000
Karen Kerwick: Or.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Bfk. Reeves, because it feels really nice. So I would use a sheet of Bfk. Reeves, 8 and a half by 11.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Print on the front and then write on the back. So even though it's a single sided paper I'm printing on the.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Correct side on the back. You write on it with a pen, and it writes fine that you don't need to have a coating on the back to write with with a pen on it, so.

01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then I bought some envelopes.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Somewhere Amazon, or something that were the correct fit.

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know, that were big enough to hold them.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And that was it. I would I would mail them out.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: All right, my, everyone. So that's.

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That's that's everything I have to say tonight on practice and portfolios. I know there was a lot there. But does anyone have any.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Questions, Harry, what paper did you use for your calendars?

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So I've made different kinds of calendars over the years.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um all from printing at home, using.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A dual sided paper. So, for example, you can use Canson.

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A photographic duo.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And that's a lighter weight paper from Canson that has. That's double-sided.

01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'm sure River Red River has it also.

01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I would print on that, and then I would um.

01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I think if I remember, I would take the calendar.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To a place like, you know.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Kinkos, or or.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The other copy places. I can't think of the names now and then. They would bind it for me.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So they would actually bind it and put a binder in the top.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I wasn't making hundreds of those that was just.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know a few. When I started selling calendars I wasn't doing any printing. I was having them commercially printed, so.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But you know the image selection process.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Was the key thing, but I was having having them printed outside.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Anybody else any any other questions, or feedback, or.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
Michelle Cambier: Robert. It's Michelle.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, Michelle.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Michelle Cambier: Did I misunderstand you? Um, maybe a couple of weeks ago, saying that you may do a course on building portfolios.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yes. Um. Well.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The course would be for Academy members. So.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:34.000
Michelle Cambier: Similar to lightroom. What you did in lightroom.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This is the introduction.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So the.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Michelle Cambier: I'm interested.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah. Great, great. Yeah. I don't think I'm going to. It's not going to be a separate course, like a separate paid for course, it'll be part of our Academy.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um sessions.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I will go deeper into making portfolios, using lightroom, etc. So that'll come in the future. Today was just to sort of.

01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Michelle Cambier: Okay.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Get the ball rolling, as it were, and give you an introduction to everything.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:56.000
Michelle Cambier: I get it. Okay.

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And get some feedback and see how many people are interested. But I think.

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Folks are. So that's great.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:01.000
Michelle Cambier: I'm definitely interested. Thanks.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay, great great thanks. Brian. Very informative. Session.

01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Thank you, Tamara, as well. Anybody else, before we sign off for today.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
Neil Rudd: Hi, Robert! It's Neil!

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: All right. Um.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah. Neil.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Neil Rudd: So one very, very interesting. I'd already been sort of.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:25.000
Neil Rudd: Toying with some different ideas on on projects, but this has helped sort of frame it a little bit.

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Neil Rudd: For me in terms of.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:30.000
Neil Rudd: You know how I might sort of pursue it, and I like the idea about.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Neil Rudd: Trying to be fairly sort of narrowly sort of focused, and that you can't go too small.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:39.000
Neil Rudd: Um cause um as an as an example.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:42.000
Neil Rudd: Um uh oops.

01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:47.000
Neil Rudd: You know I've been sort of inspired by some of what you've already sort of shared with me.

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000
Neil Rudd: And and looking at um.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000
Neil Rudd: Sort of rural landscapes.

01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:57.000
Neil Rudd: I live in the Midwest, so I don't have the luxury of the Hudson Valley.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
Neil Rudd: But I think I've been taking for granted.

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:04.000
Neil Rudd: There is so much of interest really just in rural.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:11.000
Neil Rudd: Farm life, and so, but that as I'm out sort of now, starting to drive and sort of think about that.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:16.000
Neil Rudd: It it, you know, I realize there's actually probably too much to really.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:20.000
Neil Rudd: You know, as a project. So I need it. This is helpful in terms of thinking of. Okay.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:26.000
Neil Rudd: Just as an example. Maybe it's like bonds. Or maybe it's like just different sort of crop patterns or something like that. So.

01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yep. Yep.

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:30.000
Neil Rudd: Helpful that. Okay. Now think a little bit more narrowly.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:35.000
Neil Rudd: Maybe experiment with a bunch of stuff, but a portfolio probably needs to be. Have a little bit more.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:38.000
Neil Rudd: Of a connection. So that sort of helpful.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Great.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:46.000
Neil Rudd: The other thing, which is a complete. It's largely sort of off sort of topic. But when you talk, when you started talked about a legacy portfolio.

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Mhm.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:50.000
Neil Rudd: Um. One of the things that's sort of been bouncing around my head is.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Neil Rudd: Within my Camera Club, and and we sort of encounter people all the time who are.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:07:00.000
Neil Rudd: You know, I've got friends who are in the eighties and nineties who've spent a lot of their life.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:05.000
Neil Rudd: Taking photos, and and they've got, you know, a massive sort of catalog.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:11.000
Neil Rudd: But thinking about sort of help, how to help them. Sort of shape. Sort of a legacy portfolio.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:17.000
Neil Rudd: For family. So they're not just getting someone's just not okay. I've got, you know, grandad's computer that's got.

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Neil Rudd: You know half a million images on there. What do I sort of do with that?

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Probably. Useless. Yeah.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.000
Neil Rudd: Process to help them. Sort of curate.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yes.

01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:28.000
Neil Rudd: Or even be able to sort of share sort of more broadly.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:31.000
Neil Rudd: You know a life's work, if you will.

01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:34.000
Neil Rudd: And so there's something that lives on sort of beyond them. I know it sounds.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:39.000
Neil Rudd: You know that sounds a little harsh, but we'll all be faced with that. Someday.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: No, absolutely. Yeah, no, I think it's.

01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:42.000
Neil Rudd: It makes me think about. What do I want to pass along? But.

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yes.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:45.000
Neil Rudd: How can I help people who are? You know they're.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:49.000
Neil Rudd: You know, mid late eighties, and sort of think about that process. So.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, that's great.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:56.000
Neil Rudd: Not really the topic tonight. But yeah, I'd love to explore that with you sometime, and even sort of thinking about sort of.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, yeah.

01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:00.000
Neil Rudd: You know, if I were to provide sort of some directional work with them.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Sure.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:03.000
Neil Rudd: You know, perhaps, how they could sort of think about.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:06.000
Neil Rudd: You know, shaping a portfolio like that.

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, that's great. That's a great idea. It's a great sentiment there. And yeah, I mean, there's nothing.

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It's reality, right? And so.

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:16.000
Neil Rudd: I just, I just hate to think this just goes into like the you know that. So the digital.

01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, yeah.

01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:19.000
Neil Rudd: Dustin, you know, someday.

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, I mean, I you know just an example of that. Just as an example of that, I've made a few.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Blurb books which I think are hugely underrated and amazingly powerful. Right and.

01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A family trip to Italy a few years ago our travels to Acadia with our son when he was growing up. And this is a blur book. It's maybe 30.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: 2030 pages it's got.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know 40 images in it, and.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know these things are almost falling apart because they're upstairs. My wife knows where they are. They're easy to share. They're easy to use. No one comes to my hard drive. No one looks, jumps on lightroom to look at anything.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:55.000
Neil Rudd: Exactly. Well, the books are great, and that that's something I want to do. More of.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:09:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah. Yeah. So our next, our next, our not next session. But the following session will be specifically talking about the the book module in lightroom.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Show you how to get started with that, and and then we'll continue to talk about this idea of legacy and so forth. And I'm happy to share whatever info I can to help you with your your photo club.

01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:06.000
Neil Rudd: Yeah.

01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:14.000
Neil Rudd: Yeah, just yeah. I'm thinking about some more. So maybe I'll talk at some point.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:17.000
Neil Rudd: Sort of bounce off some ideas. But you you sort of.

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yep. Yep.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:21.000
Neil Rudd: You you kind of have this. This conversation has been sort of helpful in terms of.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Oh, great, yeah. Awesome.

01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:25.000
Neil Rudd: Yeah, how? How you might compile something like that. So thank you for your time.

01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Great.

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Great. Yeah, you're you're great, great. Yes. And one last question from Harry, I think about um.

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Panoramas.

01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yes, I do. The panoramas in lightroom. If I'm not specifically.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Shooting a panorama in the field, which I can't, because I don't have a panoramic camera.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Then I changed the format in lightroom to be a panorama. I've got a.

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: An aspect ratio for that that I like, and then I try and see which images will work that way or.

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I might be actually pretty often. I'm thinking about panorama already in the field, because I know that I don't want the top or the bottom.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It's just a question of actually doing the crop in lightroom.

01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: All right. Everyone thanks for the great questions and.

01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Have a good night. I will see you at the next session. Take care.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Neil Rudd: Thank you. Robert.
