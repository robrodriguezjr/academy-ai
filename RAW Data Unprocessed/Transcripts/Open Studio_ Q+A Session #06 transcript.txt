00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Welcome, everyone! Welcome.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Welcome to our.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Academy, what I call the open studio Q. And a session.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Kind of borrowed from the kind of.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Office Hours idea, Uh.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Karen Kerwick: Nothing good.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That you find in schools, and so forth, but.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This is. I call it open studio, because you're in my studio. So.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um little uh.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Borrowing of the terms there. But yeah, this is our um.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Q. And a session for those of you who are new to the Academy. Let me pull up my list here of.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: All of you who are here. Um!

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: We do these every.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: 4 to 6 weeks. Something like that. I think it's probably been.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A little bit longer, maybe 7 weeks this time because of summer, and also other sessions that.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I was trying to squeeze in, but definitely try to do them regularly.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And and this is just a kind of an open session where.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: We can discuss things. You guys, of course, can ask any questions.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That is on your mind. Anything having to do with some of the sessions that we've been doing.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Or anything else, anything else that's related to photography, to creativity.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In general anything that I can possibly help you with.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In your, in your creative journey.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And of course.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: As the old saying is, right, there's no.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: There's no really silly question, or anything like that, because my experience is.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Usually there's someone else who has the same question. So.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: We all have our blind spots. We all have things that we wish we knew more about, and perhaps we're not too sure of.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'm constantly asking questions myself. So.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Welcome!

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Joanne Doyle. Great to see you, Joanne Michelle. Welcome, Mike.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000
michellecambier: Okay.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um Virginia Colstead.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Welcome, welcome, Carl welcome, David.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um Howard, Jerry, of course. Karen.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Karen Comstock and Karen Couric.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um Michelle, Cambria. Welcome, Mildred, of course. Neil, welcome Neil.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So yes, um.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Let me just take this off. There.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So I usually will. The way Zoom works is that um.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It kind of detects when someone is talking, and it'll switch to that person's camera and that usually works okay.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But sometimes.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If your microphone is open, which is fine, but there'll be a noise or something, and then it'll switch to that camera. So when I'm speaking I'll leave it on me, and when someone is asking a question I'll switch it to the other person, so that.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um, you know, if you have your camera on.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Everyone will see who's asking the question, etc.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So so, yeah, does anyone want to start us off tonight? Anything.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: On your mind anything you want to chat about.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
michellecambier: The heat.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The heat. Yeah. Well, it is.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
michellecambier: 100 and one.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yes, yeah. Oh, 101 where you are, Michelle. Wow.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
michellecambier: Yeah. Yes.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, that's warm. Um.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, that's yeah. It it definitely has. It has been hot. Um.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I think you've heard. You guys have heard me say before that.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It's hot. Yes, but.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I do not get along with the cold.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So my body just does not tolerate the cold anymore. So.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I would prefer to stay in the heat. The lesser of 2 evils for me.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But sure humidity. Actually, maybe some of you are in drier areas. I'm in the northeast and just north of New York.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The humidity here that that really is what makes it feel much hotter. So.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But um.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, I can't. Can't help you there, Michelle, that can't. Can't do anything about the weather. Sorry.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Anyone else.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
Jerry Stachowski: 2 questions. If I could.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Of course.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Jerry Stachowski: Um. The 1st is.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Jerry Stachowski: Um more of a printing question.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Jerry Stachowski: Um do you use like.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Jerry Stachowski: The Moab desert varnish, or the honeymole protective sprays, or that kind of thing on your Matt prints.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I have. I've experimented with all kinds of coatings and varnishes. Moab stuff is pretty good. The honey Mueller stuff is pretty good.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: There was another company years ago. I forget what they're called now, but there was a company that also produced a spray.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I think they went out of business.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um. I have used it, and I have. You know it's 1 of those things where.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um. I thought it was a great idea. I used it. I experiment with it. And and after you know some experience, I just decided.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That it wasn't quite worth the the hassle.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Number one. You need a place to spray it because it's gonna you're going to get overspray. And so you have to protect your room and so forth.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A lot of times. The fumes and so forth are also kind of strong.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The second thing is is that.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Uh it does.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Depending on the spray. I think the Hana Mula is better, but some of them will add, they just add a little bit of contrast to the image, because they're adding this, this sort of coating right.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And even if I even when I tried, even when I was buying them, I know you can buy them in at least, then I'm probably the same now. You can buy them in like in a.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Semi-gloss or luster finish and a matte finish.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But even with the matte finish you would still get the surface. Just didn't look the same.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To me, and and so between that and the hassle of it, and so forth.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I just stopped using it. Now.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The only time that I found a need to use it was.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: When I was doing prints that I wanted to show without any glass over them. So you know, just just a bare print.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If I was doing this for myself, you know. Like if I was hanging into my home, or I was doing a.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I was doing an exhibition at a coffee shop or something like that. Then I didn't care, because archivalness wasn't really a factor. When someone bought.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A print from the display. Then I would give him one that had a glass, you know, that had the protection on it.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Unfortunately or not, unfortunately. But it just so happened that people liked that look so much that they would ask me. No, no, I don't want it. I want exactly what you have on the wall. That's what I want that look in my house.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then I I would either code it, or I would explain to them what the you know, what the.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The um.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The dangers were, the risks were. If they didn't.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If they didn't, you know, if they didn't coat it and just left it bare. And most of them were okay with that, you know, so you don't want to.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Really touch it, because you're going to get oils on it. If you clean it. You want to use some kind of a.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Fine duster. Of course you want to keep it out of direct sunlight as much as possible.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know, half an hour of some sun is not going to damage it, but.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Things like that. So that that's my my answer to that. I think if you have a space where you can spray it, and you.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know you. You can incorporate that workflow to spray the prints. Then it it. Then it's then it works. They work. I just. I just got.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Didn't want to deal with the hassle.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000
Jerry Stachowski: Thank you. Um. The other question is, is.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
Jerry Stachowski: I took a seminar from John Shaw years ago.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000
Jerry Stachowski: And he was talking about for the portable drives that he took out with him in the field.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Jerry Stachowski: That he would usually throw, throw them away after about a year or so.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
Jerry Stachowski: And considering the costs of John Shaw's work.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Jerry Stachowski: I kind of understand that.

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Jerry Stachowski: Um. So how long would you continue to use an SSD in today's.

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000
Jerry Stachowski: World.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah. So, boy, you mentioned John's name because one of the 1st books that I ever bought as a photographer was one of John show's nature, and I think it was called nature photography. Actually.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So going back like 15 years, great photographer.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Uh! You know, Jerry, I have to say that I.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I can, only, you know, say, it's luck I have been. I have been very, very lucky with drives. I know other folks who have had issues, and so forth, and and stuff crashes, and so and.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I've been really lucky with drives like I in over 1520 years. I can count maybe one or 2 drives that have crashed on me.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So um, or that you know that.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That crashed and stopped working. I don't know that I would.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Well, 1st off I try to buy quality drives right? So I try to buy good stuff off the top, you know. Off the top I read the reviews, etc. Which are the Ssds that are used in.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: For example, server situations or high volume situations. Those are what they want. People want them to last a long time.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Western digital makes good drives in general, Seagate makes good drives. Samsung.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um, and then.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Try to buy good drives, and and then.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know, if I get 2 or 3 years.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Out of them. Then I'm happy, and they just kind of become like a backup.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Pile of drives that I use, you know, when I just need an extra drive to throw something on for a week or 2, or something like that, something where I need some.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Temporary storage. But if I'm.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Going on a workshop taking a trip, and I know that I need this thing to be reliable.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I probably would try to stick to a drive. That was, you know, no more than 3 years old.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Maybe John was a little more apprehensive, because maybe he had some bad experiences, etc.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You can go online and do. I can't think of the name of the site now, but there's a site that does reviews on storage.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In particular. I think it's actually storage Review, or at least it was before storagereview.com something like that.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But that's all they did. They would review all the drives and and.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know, they actually had some benchmarks where they would tell you more or less.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: How durable they were. Ssds are in theory, in principle, should last longer than regular drives, because there's no moving parts. There's nothing spinning around, etc.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So they don't have that mechanical wear and tear that spinning drives have.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: However you.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You don't. The thing about Ssds is you have to. You want to put some electric charge through them every so often.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So, you know, don't leave it sitting around for a year, and then expect it to work.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Perfectly, you know, by electric charges. You want to plug it in and use it.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And that's what keeps power going through it, and keeps the.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The the memory, as it were, functional, so.

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That's the best I can say. It's 1 of those things where it's kind of tricky to predict what's going to happen. I have Ssds that are 5 years old, and they still work fine.

00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um. Those are the early ones that I bought that are not that big because I couldn't afford the bigger ones at the time, you know. Now the prices come down.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um so um.

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, that's I would say, a couple of years at most, and then just read up on the reviews and and you'll get a good handle on which drives are you should avoid in terms of what's out there.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um so.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
Jerry Stachowski: Okay. Thank you.

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah.

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000
Karen Kerwick: What's an SSD. Drive.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You want to answer that, Jerry?

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.000
Jerry Stachowski: Sure um, the.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:36.000
Jerry Stachowski: Spinning disks one. They actually have a disk that spins, and it's got a head that seeks back and forth.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000
Karen Kerwick: Right.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000
Jerry Stachowski: SSD is just.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.000
Jerry Stachowski: An array of memory. Chips.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000
Virginia Kolstad: Right, right.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.000
Karen Kerwick: Wow!

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
Jerry Stachowski: Um. So you know there are.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
Jerry Stachowski: Um like, Robert was saying. You know.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:55.000
Jerry Stachowski: Um, they should be more reliable. But, for instance, there was a run of bad.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000
Jerry Stachowski: Bad ones that Sandisk put out.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000
Karen Kerwick: Are they pretty stable like if you're going over rough ground and traveling.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000
joannedoyle: Could I mute it? Quick.

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.000
Karen Kerwick: That's.

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Jerry Stachowski: Yeah, yeah, it's surface mount technology.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, I mean, yeah, I would say, they're the most reliable. So remember the drive, the.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Traditional drives we've had for years. It's a spinning platter like, Jerry said, and.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then there's a little head. I always thought of it like a, you know, like a record player, right? So there's a head that seeks back and forth, and.

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But it's moving. It's a mechanical thing. So if you drop a hard drive, a regular 3 and a half inch or 2.5 inch hard, drive.

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: There's a potential that it might get damaged. In fact.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: At some point apple in their Macbook pros before they were using Ssds.

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: They had this technology where, believe it or not. If your laptop fell off the table, or something.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The computer would detect that it was moving at a rate that was faster than it should move, and it would actually.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I don't know. Do something to the driver. It would go into a locked position to minimize the chance that it would.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Damage that it would get damaged, which is pretty amazing.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Solid state. As Jerry said, it's just memory. It's like, Ah, it's like solid SSD stands for solid state drive.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So it's like a RAM. Chip, RAM. I'm sure you've seen RAM Chips, but instead of doing RAM, it does long-term memory.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.000
Karen Kerwick: No.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So that even when you turn it off it maintains its memory. So there's no moving parts. You can bang, and you can throw it and.

00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know, in principle, it should. It should be fine.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If there's a bat, you know, if the company puts out a defective batch, then, of course, right like, there's nothing we can do in this heart to know what, what the.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know about that. So.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.000
Karen Kerwick: Not.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
Karen Kerwick: Can I ask some more questions?

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Of course.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000
Karen Kerwick: Um. Can you convert a Psd file to a Dng file.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um! What was the 1st type of file? Again.

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000
Karen Kerwick: What's the Photoshop? Psd, I think it's P.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Oh, Psd, it's a Dng.

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um. You can right you you can, you can. I mean, you can.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Technically convert any file to a Dng file instead of lightroom. But.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You kind of lose, or you don't really get the benefits of what a Dng file is. So a Dng file is nothing more than a.

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Adobe's open standard for raw files.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Right. So if you start with a raw file, right? So if you start with your native Nikon Olympus Canon raw file, and then you convert it to Dng.

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.000
Karen Kerwick: Okay.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Then all you're really doing is.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Converting it to a more open standard, which means that.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It's ah! It's not proprietary to the camera manufacturer, but you still have all of the.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Raw capability and the non-destructive nature of the file. So you can 0 everything out and start from scratch.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Now you asked if if you can convert a Psd file. But a Photoshop file already isn't a raw file. It's already a.

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Pixel based file, and so converting it to Dng.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know. Like, if you're starting with a non-raw, then you're not getting going to get anything out of the.

00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Benefits of the Dng, which is really specifically meant for raw files.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So I'll give you an example. Um!

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Which happens quite often when you guys.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Upload images for me, or even students? Or what have you? When I have many times when I have people send me images, and I ask for Dng files.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: When I go to edit the Dng file I will see right away that I don't have the typical controls or the adjustments that I can normally do with a regular file. Now.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The way I can, the way you know that is in lightroom.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You have, you know you'll have your exposure. You'll have your.

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Clarity. All the controls would be there.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But if you look at white balance or temperature.

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Instead of seeing the actual temperature readings like 4,000, 204,800, 5,200, you'll just see 0 minus 1, 2, 3, and 0 plus 1, 2, 3.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And as soon as I see that that means that it's no longer a raw file, you're just.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.000
Karen Kerwick: No.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It's just adding or taking away temperature. But you don't see the actual Kelvin temperature, and that that.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And that usually tells me that it isn't a raw file that they converted from a Psd file, so.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:04.000
Karen Kerwick: Okay. Um.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000
Karen Kerwick: Can you view a Psd. If we.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Karen Kerwick: Send it in for review, or it has to be um.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: No, no, I'll you know you can send me any any type of file you like. It's no no problem at all. You can send anything.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The only reason I asked for a d. And G file is that.

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:18.000
Karen Kerwick: Oh!

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um if you're if you want.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Me to have the ability to edit the original raw file.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And this way you can replicate the adjustments that I make. Then that's why I asked for a Dng. But you can send a Jpeg. Anything you like.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.000
Karen Kerwick: Okay.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000
David Tripp: I have a sort of related question, actually, um, so I'm.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.000
David Tripp: New to the Academy here, and um.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:50.000
David Tripp: So I just a couple days ago, submitted the my 1st file for you to look at.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
David Tripp: And um. Since then I've been.

00:16:53.000 --> 00:17:02.000
David Tripp: Looking at some of the old reviews that you've been doing, and I kind of figured out what you just said. Unfortunately, the file, I said I made a bunch of edits.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000
David Tripp: In Photoshop, I mean in um.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:11.000
David Tripp: Lightroom, and then I export it to Photoshop to do some distraction removal, so that the.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:14.000
Virginia Kolstad: Ah! Fashionability leak could simply mean missing out.

00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:18.000
David Tripp: Png, I submitted, doesn't. So the question I have is, would it make any sense for me to also submit.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000
Virginia Kolstad: Couple of friends miss their departing ship by only 30 min.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:28.000
David Tripp: The uh uh Dng of the one before us which would have the distractions in it. But then you could what I had done editing. Would that be helpful, or should I just leave it as it is.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.000
Virginia Kolstad: Although the ship was still at the dock, they literally missed their chance to get back on.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
Virginia Kolstad: And the party went on without them.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.000
Virginia Kolstad: What made it even worse, all of the passengers waved them goodbye from the ship.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'm gonna ask somebody to turn off their mic.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:35.000
Virginia Kolstad: Letting the message be as soon as we please.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It sounds like the news or something. Thank you.

00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um. Thank you. Um!

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So thanks for that.

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Question and.

00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I guess honestly, from my from my standpoint. It it doesn't.

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It doesn't. It's not that critically important for me. My request for the raw file.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Is to be able to make adjustments at the raw level, so that.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Whoever's image I'm working on.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Can see what adjustments it might suggest.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If your image, though the image that you want to submit for some feedback, if it relies, or it it, you know it's.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Been processed or edited outside of Lightroom and Photoshop, or some Plugin, or what have you like? You said, and that.

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Is essential to.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know the image that you want to convey that you want to share. Then then, yeah, I would say, send me.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Send me the the, you know. Send the image that you feel. Okay, this is the. This is what I really feel strongly about. This is my my interpretation of the file.

00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If that means that you're going out to some plugin or something, then then that's fine. So it's not.

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: There. Really, there is no wrong way to send it in.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I just wanted to clarify from the technical standpoint.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.000
David Tripp: Yeah.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That if you think.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:19:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That you're sending me a real raw, but you've already done it in something in Photoshop. I'm not getting a real raw. It's just more of a factual thing than it is like a preference from my standpoint.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Does that make sense.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000
David Tripp: Yeah, I understand. And and perhaps I I.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:13.000
David Tripp: The the things I did in Photoshop. I probably could have done in the latest releases of lightroom, and so maybe in the future I might do that just so that you can see everything I've done. But.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, sure. Yeah, sure. And you know, um may maybe at some point.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000
David Tripp: Did do it in.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:16.000
Howard Krieger: True.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Maybe at some point it could be interesting, you know, depending how much time we have. But it could be interesting from a learning exercise.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Let's say some of you have an image where you've done stuff in Photoshop. And you say, gee! I know that I can do that. I'm not sure.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Send me both, and I'll look at it and say, Gee, okay, I think I know what you're doing there. Here's how I think I might be able to do that in lightroom. We can compare.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So, you know, I'll maybe I'll keep that in mind for a future session. But.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But sure, as I said, whatever.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000
Howard Krieger: As I said, whatever you feel is the most.

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You feel is the most faithful to your.

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Vision of the image. Send me that.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.000
David Tripp: Okay. Thanks.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000
Howard Krieger: Hi, Robert! It's Howie!

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah. Hi, Howard, how are you?

00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:02.000
Howard Krieger: Good evening. I just wanted to ask you. I'm doing well, thank you. I just wanted to ask you in a general way.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.000
Howard Krieger: You know, with the changes with adobe, and the frequency and.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:14.000
Howard Krieger: You know. How does one really know if they're on top of it? I mean, I see what adobe sends out. I see their instructional.

00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:16.000
Howard Krieger: Kind of hints, and so forth.

00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:22.000
Howard Krieger: But how it relates, or you know, to what I'm doing, and if it can help me.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:28.000
Howard Krieger: You know. Is it a pick through it as they release? You know, or you talk about something.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000
Howard Krieger: If that all makes sense.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So if I.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If I understand your question, are you asking.

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: How do you keep up on all the updates, or whether it's worth updating.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:44.000
Howard Krieger: Yeah, I'm making evaluation. Not only.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000
Howard Krieger: How do you stay up to date with it?

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah.

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.000
Howard Krieger: But to see if it really.

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.000
Howard Krieger: Applies those updates to.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:58.000
Howard Krieger: You know what we do or would like to do, or you know something of that nature, and know that we're doing it right.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.000
Howard Krieger: You know.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Sure. Yeah. Um.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Well.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um, I certainly. My. My aspiration, at least, is to keep you guys updated on all the new features because I.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Definitely stay as soon as they as soon as they release a new update. I get it immediately, because.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.000
Howard Krieger: Yeah, that's good. That's good.

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know, lightroom is is something I work in every day. It's something that I teach, of course, so I want to.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Stay on top of of all the new features, and then.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know, quite. It's an interesting question, in fact. So, for example, this very last update, they added a couple of things.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And they're not. They're not night and day differences, right? So I haven't.

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Set aside like a specific session to talk about the updates I usually think about, or was going to think about rolling.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.000
Howard Krieger: It's like.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Talking about them, you know, rolling them in. So, for example, this Wednesday.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: We're doing our feedback session again.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I'll have probably a good opportunity there to show a few of the new things that they've added, and I've talked about them a little bit in some of the other sessions, so.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If it's a major thing, then I will for sure in the Academy, set aside time to talk about that.

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: What they've been adding so far is sort of incremental things. So.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: For example, here's a great example. If you use.

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If you're familiar with the Denoise feature right where.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The aid noise in the past. You clicked on Denoise. It created a new Dng file.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And that new Dng file had the Denoise applied to it. And so you wound up with 2 images in your catalog, one with the.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The original, and one that's denoised. All right.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Now, if I have this image here, or let me go to, let's go to this one here.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:39.000
Howard Krieger: Let's go to this one here.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If I want to denoise this image now, you'll notice that when I go down to the.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.000
Howard Krieger: Let me go back to the.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Detail Panel.

00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay. Now we have a little checkbox that, says Denoise.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Alright. So there's no longer that button that you would click on, and then it would go through this process. So if I just click on this checkbox.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.000
joannedoyle: Yeah.

00:22:54.000 --> 00:23:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay, it sort of does what it used to do before. All right it. It takes some time to apply the Denoise.

00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um. But when it's done.

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It's still the same file.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You don't get a duplicate file now, so it doesn't generate another file. And then, if you don't want to, denoise, you just uncheck that button.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.000
Howard Krieger: So it doesn't take.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Simple as that. So that's a 1 little feature that.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Is just a kind of an extension of probably something, you know already, but now it's done in a much simpler way.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So you see it when it's.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It'll take a little time here a little bit longer.

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Then there's no duplicating of the files which makes your library management.

00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I think easier. That's it. It's denoist.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Right, and there's no new file or whatever. And if I want to take it off, or let's say I want to adjust it. I can use this fader here to adjust it.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.000
Howard Krieger: Give me just.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That's if you recall. Now, this is also kind of nice, because before you had to set the amount of Denoise, and then commit to the Denoise, and it created a new file.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:24:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Now they're keeping it more like what a raw file should be, which is that I can adjust this on the fly, or I can adjust it to my, you know, non-destructively.

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And if I decide I don't want the Denoise.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000
Howard Krieger: If I decide.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That turns it off, and the same with the super resolution.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This is very interesting also, which means that instead of creating a new file.

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That is twice as big as the original file.

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And if you remember, I had talked about.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You had to decide whether to keep the new one or the old one, or decide to keep them both. And it became it was kind of messy.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Now, if I just click the super resolution, I won't do it, because it'll probably take another minute. Now it actually with this checkbox. Your file is effectively.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Twice as big.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:34.000
Howard Krieger: Twice as big.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If I uncheck that it goes back to the original size.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.000
Howard Krieger: If I don't check that.

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Which is kind of cool, because that means that you can decide. Now.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000
Howard Krieger: It's kind of cool.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know when to use it and when not to use it. So that's 1.

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Uh one of the.

00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: One of 2 major features that they've added, in other words, this, the.

00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Ability to apply Denoise and super resolution.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Without creating another file.

00:24:55.000 --> 00:25:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Also keep in mind that the super resolution, when I say twice as big.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That means twice as big width and height.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It effectively quadruples your resolution. So if your original image was 20 megapixels.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You get an 80 megapixel image.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Because it's width and height. Okay?

00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The other major feature that they announced, which is also again kind of an extension of what we've done before, and I'm not that impressed by it.

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Is, if you go to create a mask up here.

00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: There's 1 new.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Option. Now, which is landscape.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So before we had subject sky, background.

00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Objects brush and the brush, and those are the oldest ones that we're familiar with.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Now you have one called landscape, and what it does is that if you click on it.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It will detect what's in the image.

00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then create automatic masks. For, for example, the sky. So down here you can see that it created a mask for the sky.

00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: We can do that already with the sky mask, but then it made one for the mountains.

00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This is why I'm not too impressed with it, because the mask also includes those rocks in the foreground.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So that's not mountains. But okay.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Then we've got vegetation.

00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay, that's the mountains. But.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then we've got the water. So it's good. It's interesting, but not great yet, and of course you can. You can adjust these masks.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So it's basically if you've ever used the.

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The person mask, where it kind of creates masks for the face and the body and the eyes, and.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This is the same thing for landscape. I think it's I think it's a good start. I think it can be improved if if they're using AI for this. It can get better, because, as you can see.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know, got rocks, and you can delete them. But now you got to go through an extra step, and then you've got vegetation.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Which is the same as the mountains, but.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I didn't quite capture the shadows, and so I'm.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:27:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know I'm still old school. In a sense, I just go for just a simple brush that I can just hit what I want to hit, but this is getting better. The sky, for example, the sky mask.

00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Both here and in your normal sky mask is pretty good. I use that quite often.

00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: When it you know, when when it and when it works.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um. So yeah, those are. So those are the 2 big things. Everything else is really, you know, nothing's.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Changed that much.

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000
Neil Rudd: Robert, can I ask you a question?

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000
Howard Krieger: I don't know.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000
Neil Rudd: Well, it's a different topic.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Of course. Yeah.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:28.000
Neil Rudd: Uh. So I fortunate in the sense I get to travel quite a bit for different reasons. But.

00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000
Neil Rudd: It's rarely, exclusively for photography.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.000
Neil Rudd: But I have my gear with me.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:39.000
Neil Rudd: Um. But there's often a situation where I'm someone new, where I know. There's, you know, interesting things to.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:44.000
Neil Rudd: To to go out and and visit and potentially photograph. But.

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:50.000
Neil Rudd: You know, I might have one morning, or one evening, or a couple of hours, sort of here and there.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000
Neil Rudd: And I'm curious, and I I.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:28:00.000
Neil Rudd: I'm sort of trying to do a better job of sort of preparing for that. Realizing this might be the one opportunity I have to visit this location.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:04.000
Neil Rudd: And I'm trying to do something more than just maybe a snapshot.

00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:10.000
Neil Rudd: I am curious from you, or frankly from the whole group, because I imagine other people have had this experience is just.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:17.000
Neil Rudd: Tips you have in terms of preparing in advance. If you know I've I've got this one chance to go. This location I've got one morning.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.000
Neil Rudd: How do I get the most out of it?

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So I take it from your question. You're talking really about the familiarity with the terrain and the features, and the you know the opportunities of the place. You're going.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000
Neil Rudd: Yes.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You're not talking about preparation from your side.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In other words, your gear, or your mental state, or things like that.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.000
Neil Rudd: Yeah.

00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:44.000
Neil Rudd: No, no, no, I mean, yeah, maybe at some point sort of gear in terms of thinking about, but more so.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:49.000
Neil Rudd: Sort of just thinking about. You know the location terrain times of day, you know.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:29:08.000
Neil Rudd: Um, you know. And yeah, I've you know I'll often go, and if it's if it's someplace that's, you know, sort of more iconic, you can easily sort of search on examples of images, and it may be enough to just sort of get one that. Okay, I was looking at how he's early. I'm actually in the Bay Area. Incidentally, and.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.000
Neil Rudd: I was going to go out to Kirby Beach, which I think is.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:18.000
Neil Rudd: Above the photo. That's sort of behind him, or at least he's on the outlook there, looking across the bay. So.

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:26.000
Neil Rudd: You know, I'll go and look, and images and sort of scout look for areas. But again, I'm just looking for suggestions. The things that you sort of learned in terms of.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.000
Neil Rudd: Okay, if you've got, you know. One morning.

00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:42.000
Neil Rudd: You know how you can sort of best sort of virtually scout, I guess, even if you don't have the opportunity to go there in advance and actually see these locations. You know, perhaps, what you might do or what other people do, just to try and get the most out of that experience.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, I mean, that's a that's a.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That's a great question. I you know I feel like I've had that experience.

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Hundreds of times right? Because um.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Especially when you're in new places. You're just sort of going out and scouting and seeing what's available.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I think if I have.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A little bit of time to prepare. If I have a little bit of time to do some research.

00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Obviously, I use Google Earth. So that's 1 of the main things that I like to use, because Google Earth will give you some really nice.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Ah! You know the satellite views give you a sense of.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know what's what it looks like, how, whether they're open spaces, where it's all, how.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know, if it's dense vegetation, or what have you.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So I use a little bit of that just to get a lay of the land, so to speak.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And it also depends on the terrain. If it's in an area that's forested and so forth, then I kind of take that with a grain of salt, because you just don't know what you're going to find. Once you're on the ground, as it were. The satellite just shows you the tops of the trees.

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But Google Earth is one.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um.

00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Uh one.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Tool. Another thing I try to do, I guess, is.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I mean, I guess if I'm going, and I know that I can just get there at sunrise or sunset.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Then, you know, then it's just sort of for me. I just see it as like, you know, like a kid in a candy store, so to speak, or.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Just go out and exploring and leave.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The expectations of getting something really good.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Try to try to tamper that if you will, and just kind of have fun.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If I have a day. Let's say I've had a day, and I want to go someplace for sunset.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And this is what I do. When I scout for workshops I definitely will go just during the day just to see what it looks like.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Get a sense of where the sun is going to set. Get a sense of the features that I like, and maybe I'll use a tool like photopills.

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And photopills as this.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: AR feature, augmented reality feature will actually show you where the sun is going to set. So I see, okay, it's going to set over there.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And there's a boulder there, or trees, or a rock, or a mountain that's going to block it. So.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'm not actually going to have any light right at sunset, so getting there at least once before the light is going to be great.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:54.000
Neil Rudd: Mhm.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That's a huge for me. That's been huge. It just gives me a little bit more of awareness versus just walking into a completely foreign.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:03.000
Neil Rudd: Yeah.

00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Environment. That's the kind of the best I can tell you. I mean, if it's a place that's popular, then of course, you can do a search online and get ideas for pictures and stuff.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But a lot of times, you know, I'm going someplace where there's it's not like an actual landmark. It's just okay. I'm going to be driving down this road.

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In this place, and maybe I want to see if there's a few scenes or views that I can capture, or more than likely I'm hiking someplace.

00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: For hiking. If I'm hiking.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'll use guidebooks, even if it's the guidebook is just for a hiker. But they'll typically point out.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Scenic spots and things like that. And the scenic spots are definitely a place where, you know, you can set up a camera and get.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: An interesting picture. So.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That's kind of the yeah. I mean, that's kind of the best I you know.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'd be interested to hear what others do if they have any strategies.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.000
michellecambier: Robert, if I may. It's Michelle.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Sure.

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:57.000
michellecambier: Travel a lot uh photographing, and what I do is uh to prepare. I.

00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.000
michellecambier: Once again I try to see what other people are photographing.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.000
michellecambier: But I I have many years ago, I think, in.

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:08.000
michellecambier: 2010. I subscribed to photograph America.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yes, I I did as I did as well. Yeah.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.000
michellecambier: Robert Management's Magazine.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:22.000
michellecambier: And so that has helped me tremendously because I have the collection, and if I know I'm going to that to a particular place, I will read it, I will research it.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.000
michellecambier: And I would try to get a sense of the place.

00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:31.000
michellecambier: Another thing I always do is I either go a couple of days ahead or a couple of days.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:33.000
michellecambier: After.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:40.000
michellecambier: Because when I'm in a photo workshop there may be places I want to revisit that we couldn't.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:47.000
michellecambier: At a sunset for a sunrise, so that allows me the opportunity then to go back to those places.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:53.000
michellecambier: Without the pressure of this is where we're going to be now, and we got to get this done.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:34:01.000
michellecambier: So I either, and most likely I go one day ahead, but then I'll stay like 3 or 4 days afterwards.

00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:06.000
michellecambier: To go back to those places that I might want to revisit.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, yeah. Great. Yeah, those are great ideas. Photograph America is. I don't know if he's if he's still around or not.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:13.000
michellecambier: It's still viable. Now it's in color.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay? Good. Yeah. So it's just this, I forget the guy's name. But he's a guy that.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.000
michellecambier: Robert H. Man.

00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: There you go, Robert Hitchman. So he puts out these newsletters.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Or these guides to.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:24.000
michellecambier: Their guides.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Mostly to parks and regions, you know. So if it's not Yosemite, it's the Sierra Nevada, or places like that. But they're known places.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I didn't think of that before, because I was thinking when Neil asked me the question, if it's just a place that isn't.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Particularly well-known. You just happen to be someplace, and then you want to go and explore an area. But if it's a decently well-known area.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Then, of course, you've got resources where you can search, and you can use this guy's guides, and he again, mostly national parks and regions that are similar, and he.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:57.000
michellecambier: But he'll he'll do like now. He's doing like the back roads of Oregon.

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Tells you more, more or less what to look for.

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, something like that.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:05.000
michellecambier: When I was in Oregon in in September, I I use this back roads to more or less.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Awesome. Yeah. Yeah. Great. Yeah. So.

00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:09.000
michellecambier: You know, scall places that he has already been to.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, that's great. Yeah. I think I had one for the.

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Northern Vermont, you know, for autumn colors, etc, things like that so.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000
michellecambier: Right.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.000
joannedoyle: Robert. It's Joanne.

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah. Join?

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:29.000
joannedoyle: Um. I have a couple of questions. Um. Occasionally. I've been playing with the Hdr.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:34.000
joannedoyle: Um function in lightroom and the development module.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:40.000
joannedoyle: Um. And every so often I hit on a photo that I'm like, Okay, that.

00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.000
joannedoyle: Does improve it somewhat.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:49.000
joannedoyle: So I'll do my regular workflow, and then I'll hit the Hdr. And I'm just wondering um.

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:52.000
joannedoyle: If I kept it in Hdr.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.000
joannedoyle: How does that impact the printing of it?

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Well, so when you.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:04.000
joannedoyle: Well, it seems like the colors could be a little wonky, and I'm.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, yeah.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.000
joannedoyle: The.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The so the tricky thing with Hdr. Is that.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Optimally right to use. Hdr, you want to start with an Hdr image.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So you can go into Hdr with any image but.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You're not really getting the benefits of Hdr, Hdr. Really means a couple of.

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Either exposures that you're blending together, or if you've got an image that is shot in Hdr mode, because then you get more.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Color, separation, and certainly more.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Dynamic range than you would in a regular image.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.000
joannedoyle: Does that mean? If I'm bracketing a shot I.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah. Well, yes, like, if you bracket a shot and then you can. You can combine them in Hdr mode. So one for the shadows, one for the mid-tones, one for the highlights.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I mentioned one image.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That's an Hdr image, because I don't know about cameras. But, for example, smartphones like the iphone will actually.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Take an image in Hdr. Mode, and combine them all into one.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:59.000
joannedoyle: To Hdr, right? The camera pro, does. Yeah.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: File, yeah, right.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So that will allow you to go into Hdr mode in lightroom, and then.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You'll get access to more of the dynamic range in an image.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But you have to remember that.

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So when you go into Hdr mode, you have a preview for Sdr display, so I'll show you what that looks like. Real quick.

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:18.000
joannedoyle: Yeah, I saw that.

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So, for example, this image is not Hdr. I would have to search for one, but.

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um. There is a.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Once you've you're done doing your Hdr adjustments right? There's a little checkbox that says Preview for Sdr. Display.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And you notice that it immediately sort of dulls the image down a bit.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.000
joannedoyle: Right.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Because without that on you're seeing.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: All of the available colors. But those colors are not going to. You're not going to be able to reproduce those when you.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Uh either print to, you know, when you print on paper.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Or even when you export it to, you know, to show on the web, because unless somebody has an Hdr. Monitor, and those are.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Rare. They're not going to be able to see all the colors. So this allows you to preview it.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So that that's how it's going to look.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: When you print it on paper, or when you you know when you export it.

00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:06.000
joannedoyle: That's good.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um. So that's what that's what that's for. Now.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: For viewing on screen. Of course you get more of the colors and so forth.

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And you can use the tone mapping. That's how you kind of combine all the exposures together to get a little more dynamic range.

00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Etc. But it's ah, it's not easy. It's kind of an art form to get a good looking. Hdr. That doesn't look like Hdr. Right?

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um. So I would say, if if you're not starting with an Hdr image, and you just.

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Using that Hdr function.

00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You're probably not getting really much out of it. That again, it's it's only going to really give you the potential of the of an image when you're starting with in Hdr. Mode. But you're certainly not going to get Hdr. An Hdr.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Looking image until you compress those tones, and then you.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Then you print.

00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:00.000
joannedoyle: Okay, that makes sense. And the other question, which is kind of in the same.

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:09.000
joannedoyle: Um realm that the adaptive color, and then adaptive black and white. And what what's the difference? I mean, if you pick.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:19.000
joannedoyle: If you want to start off with just a preset in black and white, you know from adobe, how is that different than using the adaptive black and white.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay. So I will once again.

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Switch to my screen.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I will show you that I'm just going to try to find an image that I can use that on.

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I want to find something that has very pretty bright. Okay, so let's go with.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Let's just go with something like this. Okay, um.

00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Actually no, let me go to something a little bit older.

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Then I will show you.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay, let's try. Let's try this. This is a good image, because it's.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A lot of exposure. So this is a good example. Right? So this is shooting kind of into the sun, and you can see.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Sun is really bright. Really hot. Okay.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Now the difference between.

00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Any of the profiles.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And the adaptive profiles, and you will see that the adaptive profile is up here by itself. Above this line.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then you've got all the other. Let's call them your.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Normal.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Regular profiles, and then down here you got the adaptive black and white.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That's not above a line, but it's still separate from the other black and white.

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Profiles. The difference is that.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Watch as I choose, and change these profiles.

00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Color Landscape Portrait.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Doesn't matter which one I go here. I'm just having a I'm getting a little bit of change in the colors. I'm getting a little bit of change in the.

00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know the the vibrancy of the saturation.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But you're not getting a change in the dynamic range, or even in the.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Individual parts of the image.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Watch when I change to adaptive color.

00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: All right. That's a huge difference.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.000
joannedoyle: Oh, wow!

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: What adapt, what adaptive, what adaptive color does.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Is that it will actually create masks for your image.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay? And those masks.

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Depend on what's bright, what's dark, and then it'll adjust.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Local parts of the image, so the adaptive profile will adjust the image locally, whereas the.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Whereas the all the other profiles don't adjust the image locally, no matter which profile I pick here my sky is still blown out.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But as soon as I select the adaptive color.

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It actually is creating a max for the top here and.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:42.000
joannedoyle: Can you? Can you see that if you go into the mask.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: No, no, that's a great question. No, you have no access to that mask.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:45.000
joannedoyle: Oh!

00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The mask is done in the profile itself, so notice that I don't have any mask. Look! My mask panel is empty.

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:55.000
joannedoyle: Yeah, that's what I was wondering whether you could see what they were doing.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:42:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, yeah, no, you. So you can't. So the you don't have any access to those masks. So the masks are sort of AI generated.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Based on what it thinks is going to make the image look, you know, make the image look better.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Similarly, if I go into the adaptive black and white.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay, let's go to a regular monochrome again. Sky's blown out. If I go to the adaptive black and white.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You'll see right away that it is a much better version of this image.

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Because it's, you know, brought back.

00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The highlights, and made the image much less blown out. And then, of course, from here I can continue to work so.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: My suggestion to you and to everyone is.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And this is what I do is.

00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I try the adaptive profile. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't work. I would say. In this case it works, it's working pretty nice. It's it's definitely made. The image.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Brought the image much closer to what I would want. I don't want the sky blown out. I took the image because you could see these mountains up here, and the sky, and these rays.

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Now I can. I'm in a much. I'm much closer to the kind of image that I'd want to make.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Now I can, you know, adjust the exposure.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I can do other things. I can now create my own manual masks, masks.

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: For the different parts of the image, etc.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Sometimes the adaptive doesn't work.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So it does does something that I don't like.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um, I don't know. Let's try this image here.

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If I try the adaptive color here.

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay, so.

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:22.000
joannedoyle: Okay.

00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um.

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I prefer what I had.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So I'm going to undo that right. That's the one I had. And now that feels a little smoother to me, I don't need individual masks for the sky in the foreground and the in the background.

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.000
joannedoyle: Right.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So, sometimes it works.

00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Or or sometimes it. It gives you what you want, and sometimes it doesn't.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.000
joannedoyle: Okay. Thank you.

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So yeah, just experiment with it, try. But it can be very powerful. As I showed you in that other image.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Here's another example here. Here's an image that has a very blown out.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Sky very difficult to mask this out.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Let's see what the adaptive color does. So if I come here adaptive color.

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Right, and that's that's a bit better, I mean. Now I'm closer now. The sky isn't as blown out my clouds. I got back some.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Texture in some detail, and then I can now continue to work on it.

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So it kind of moves you a little bit further ahead in your editing. If.

00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If you think that it's actually doing that.

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:21.000
joannedoyle: Okay, have you ever printed anything after after using these functions.

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Oh, yeah, yeah, sure. Yeah, I mean.

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The.

00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Whatever you you know, whatever you have on screen. In other words, regardless of what you do to your image in terms of the editing.

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Whatever you see on screen. If you're happy with that, and it looks good. That's what.

00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know in principle.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That's what you should get on paper. So it doesn't matter how you're getting there, what tools you're using.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: What you see on screen. Trust your eyes, trust your intuition about what you're looking at.

00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That's why it's important to have a calibrated monitor. That's really, really important.

00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And to have a, you know, a good monitor.

00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: One thing I will mention.

00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Is that I think it was Karen who asked in the Forum about.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: a 4 k. Monitor and.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: How to connect it.

00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A lot of the new monitors now have a USB-c connection to your laptop or to your desktop.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Versus HDMI, and the USB-c connection actually will give you greater.

00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Color depth than the USB-c connection.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'm sorry. Then the HDMI connection.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So if you're you should check. If your monitor has a USB-c input.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And if it does.

00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And you have a computer that has a USB-c output that will power a monitor. That's a better way to connect your monitor than using HDMI.

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This is going to apply typically to.

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'm not too familiar with windows, laptops, but any of the.

00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Late model macbook pros.

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Mac Mini, that I have. Everything's connected through USB-c.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.000
joannedoyle: Okay. Thank you.

00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:57.000
Mark Zelyony: Oh!

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It's also a smaller connector, not as big as the HDMI, and and actually gives you more capabilities that you can. They can send more information through the Usbc.

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Ah protocol than they can through the HDMI protocol.

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:16.000
joannedoyle: That's helpful. Thank you.

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, no. Problem.

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:20.000
Mark Zelyony: Roger. That was me. Very interesting topic attached. Uh.

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:22.000
Mark Zelyony: Marcus! Here! Um.

00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, yeah, sure. Mark.

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:30.000
Mark Zelyony: When you say monitor is connected via USB, CC. Is it actually connected? Uh.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:33.000
Mark Zelyony: Is it actually getting the video data.

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:37.000
Mark Zelyony: Via USB. Or it just connects as an external device kinda.

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:40.000
Mark Zelyony: With its own video card.

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um, it's well on the so on the on the Macbook pros. If a macbook pro has.

00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:48.000
Mark Zelyony: Yes.

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Ah, typically, they have 2 or 3 USB-c outputs.

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:54.000
Mark Zelyony: Yep.

00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You can use any of the USB-c outputs to connect to a monitor.

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: On my Mac Mini. I have USB-c outputs.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:01.000
Mark Zelyony: Oh!

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I can use any of them. I only have.

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: One monitor that supports USB-c, so I have that monitor connected on USB-c. And then I have an older monitor that I don't use for critical color. It's just kind of an extra monitor to bring screens up on.

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And that one only has HDMI. So I use the lone HDMI output on my.

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um. Actually, I'm sorry.

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I have 3 monitors. I also have a teleprompter. The teleprompter is also connected to a USB-c, and that's also a video. So yeah, it's actually sending the full video signal. In fact, you get.

00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:30.000
Mark Zelyony: Interesting.

00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Ten-bit signal through the USB-c. Whereas, HDMI, you don't get that.

00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.000
Mark Zelyony: But then, in that case.

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:37.000
Mark Zelyony: If you are.

00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:40.000
Mark Zelyony: Editing for the better colors.

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Mhm.

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:44.000
Mark Zelyony: Of the um more advanced monitor.

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:50.000
Mark Zelyony: How do you account for everybody else who doesn't have those colors on their monitors, or pay well.

00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.000
Mark Zelyony: Paper is probably separate.

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, yeah, yeah, um, well, because.

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:59.000
Mark Zelyony: But but everybody else is running on. Say, this display port or Gmi, or anything like that.

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah. Well, um.

00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I mean. So my monitor is a wide gamut monitor. So it's adobe 98, right? And that's a standard color space that you guys are going to have if you have a wide gamut monitor. So you know, I don't have any more color capability. There.

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And if I'm using, if I have 10 bit, output.

00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um. Then that just means that I have a little bit more.

00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Depth and the highlights and the shadows. But.

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um. I don't think that there's much of a there's not gonna be much of a difference between what I'm seeing here and what you're seeing there, particularly if.

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Your monitor is going to.

00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Through your monitor profile, accommodate.

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Whatever you're getting, you know, over zoom.

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Does that make sense.

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:43.000
Mark Zelyony: Yeah, well, it kind of does. But I that's.

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I mean, that's why I mentioned the calibration. So calibration very important. Because that makes what the calibration essentially does is this is okay.

00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This is the monitor that I'm using.

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Make sure that I'm getting the maximum color accuracy, and also the maximum depth of you know, highlights and shadows, so that.

00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: What I've seen. What I'm seeing is true. It's neutral and.

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Blacks are blacks and whites are whites. Given. My monitor.

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I'm assuming that if my black is a tiny bit darker it's going to the profile is going to adjust that. So that you see that same black on your side.

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:19.000
Mark Zelyony: Yeah, well, that.

00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:25.000
Mark Zelyony: Think always bothers me, because when I edit an image in lightroom or.

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:28.000
Mark Zelyony: Something else, and.

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Mhm.

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:30.000
Mark Zelyony: Well, obviously. Edit.

00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.000
Mark Zelyony: Based on a high.

00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:36.000
Mark Zelyony: Bitcount bit row, B. Jpeg, but still high bit count.

00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Mhm.

00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:40.000
Mark Zelyony: Per pixel, and then he exported.

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:46.000
Mark Zelyony: And you display it on a genetic website like, I don't know Flickr Facebook and.

00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah.

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:49.000
Mark Zelyony: And and then I met a lot of words.

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Why, it doesn't look as good.

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:53.000
Mark Zelyony: Comparing left monitor and right, monitor.

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah. White doesn't look why, it doesn't look as good. Yeah, that.

00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That's that's just the that's just the nature of it. Unfortunately.

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:04.000
Mark Zelyony: I mean, just colors are shifted, or they they're all situated through like locking the tails over there.

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, well.

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Again the.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This is why I always suggest, or I.

00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It's very important when you export your images for the web.

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You always want to export them in the Srgb color profile, so I always export out of lightroom.

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And use. Srgb, because now you're compressing the colors from the original color space.

00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yes, you're going to lose.

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Some of the richness in the Reds or the blues, but at least.

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It'll be compressed in a way that is faithful to your original versus.

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Hoping that the other person's monitor gets the colors right.

00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So what I'm basically talking about is if you.

00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If you're going to export this image when you go to the export dialog here.

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And you're exporting. You know this is how you always want to export your images to share on the web, or anything like that.

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um right here in.

00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The file settings.

00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This is the color space that it's going to.

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Translate this image into, or.

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Convert this image to an Srgb.

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Is the de facto standard.

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Color, space for everything, online.

00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: All web browsers use Srgb, and so this means that your colors are going to be.

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Compressed to colors that everyone else can see. Assuming that they have, you know.

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Decent monitor, and it's set up properly.

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If you don't adjust this color space.

00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Or use a larger one.

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Then what happens is that.

00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Their computer is going to have to do this adjustment, and they may or may not have it set up, and then you may see, they may see, you know.

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Wildly different colors or colors that don't look right, or, etc.

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Does that make sense to everyone?

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:44.000
Hillel Brandes: That makes sense.

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:49.000
joannedoyle: Hmm.

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Questions.

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:51.000
Mark Zelyony: And actually, there is one more thing.

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:55.000
Mark Zelyony: Which is not a question, but I want to share with everybody.

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay.

00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:58.000
Mark Zelyony: I totally occasionally stump.

00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:02.000
Mark Zelyony: Stumbled upon a plugin to lightroom.

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:05.000
Mark Zelyony: Which shows you all the focus information.

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:12.000
Mark Zelyony: From your image, including the Autofocus point. Your camera chose at the time of the shooting.

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Like an overlay.

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:14.000
Mark Zelyony: Highlight. Ah!

00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Like an overlay.

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:20.000
Mark Zelyony: Yeah, the same as the well. I know that usually.

00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay.

00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:24.000
Mark Zelyony: The native editing tools from the camera makers show that.

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:33.000
Mark Zelyony: But this is 1st time I saw it in lightroom with the standard email, with the images for all the major makers.

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay, what's it called.

00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:37.000
Mark Zelyony: It's called. I'm gonna Post, the link.

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:40.000
Mark Zelyony: In the chat it's called.

00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:42.000
Mark Zelyony: Focus point.

00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:44.000
Mark Zelyony: It's uh.

00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:51.000
Mark Zelyony: It's available on Github. It's supported by the community. It's people kind of like.

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:55.000
Mark Zelyony: For both photographers and programmers.

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, chipping in to make it better.

00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay. All right. Cool.

00:52:57.000 --> 00:53:00.000
Mark Zelyony: And uh I was very impressed. It's uh.

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:04.000
Mark Zelyony: You can pull a lot of into interesting information from there.

00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And so you can see in Lightroom, where your focus point was for an image.

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:13.000
Mark Zelyony: Yes, and then it allows you. It shows you what was the.

00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: All right. That's very cool. That's useful.

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:20.000
Mark Zelyony: Focal distance. It shows you what was the hyperfocal distance. It shows you what would be considered.

00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:23.000
Mark Zelyony: The ages of the uh.

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.000
Mark Zelyony: Sharp depth.

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay. Wow.

00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:28.000
Mark Zelyony: Year and 4, and so on, and so on.

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Interesting. Yeah, it's interesting. Wow, all right, I'll have to check that out for sure.

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That's always a question I'm asking. It's always a question I'm asking myself. You know, where was my focus or.

00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:34.000
Mark Zelyony: And it's totally free.

00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:39.000
Mark Zelyony: Yeah, I mean, I know. I know it's the the information, is there.

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah.

00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:46.000
Mark Zelyony: Cause you're when you browsing your images in camera on the back on the back display. Sure, you see.

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You see it? Yeah, you see it? Yeah, yeah. In your camera. You do. Yeah.

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:52.000
Mark Zelyony: If, for example, I'm shooting Olympus, and I use the Olympus raw video, raw, raw edit.

00:53:52.000 --> 00:53:54.000
Mark Zelyony: It shows it there as well.

00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, yeah, lightroom is probably not.

00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:57.000
Mark Zelyony: But now people brought it over to Lightroom.

00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Good. Yeah, lightroom is probably not pulling it in.

00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: For whatever reason.

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:05.000
Mark Zelyony: And yes, as I, as I said, it's totally free. It's community community supported.

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Cool. Thank you.

00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um.

00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: All right. Anyone else have any questions before we.

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Wrap up tonight.

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Anybody at all.

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: All right. Well, I think that.

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:24.000
Mark Zelyony: Actually, I do have one more question.

00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay.

00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:30.000
Mark Zelyony: Unrelated to what we just spoke. It's probably more related to Michelle what was bringing up.

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:33.000
Mark Zelyony: Ah! You're showing some images.

00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:37.000
Mark Zelyony: Ah! Where the.

00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:39.000
Mark Zelyony: See the sky.

00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:42.000
Mark Zelyony: Was significantly changed.

00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:45.000
Mark Zelyony: From the regional to what your target image is.

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:49.000
Mark Zelyony: And sometimes people add warmth.

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:51.000
Mark Zelyony: To the sky.

00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:56.000
Mark Zelyony: And at that point I always get lost because uh.

00:54:56.000 --> 00:55:01.000
Mark Zelyony: The sky is usually blue, like blue cyan, something like that.

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:04.000
Mark Zelyony: If you add warmth to the sky itself.

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:06.000
Mark Zelyony: It starts loading that bluishness.

00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:12.000
Mark Zelyony: It does so, the the warm part looks good on the clouds. If you have.

00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:18.000
Mark Zelyony: But on the sky background it doesn't. How do you find the balance, or what do you do about it?

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:22.000
Mark Zelyony: Or do you do anything like uh split total for sky or any minute?

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, yeah, no, that's that's interesting. I I think it's um.

00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I think it's a matter of the balance. So.

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I think many times I've worked on images.

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Not only on my own, but perhaps when we do the feedback sessions, where I would.

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'll adjust the temperature. And I'll say, Okay, you know, it needs to be a little bit warmer, a little bit cooler.

00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And and I'll specifically say this is a little bit too much, because now we're losing the blueness of the sky, we're losing the coolness in the sky, and then I'll pull that back.

00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So I think it's just a question of I think it's a question of balance.

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: For me! Um.

00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If I want. So here, let me show you an example here. Okay.

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And that's the easiest.

00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:07.000
Mark Zelyony: Well, yeah. Okay.

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This image here, I think.

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I don't remember if I went into this adaptive color. Okay.

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So just very quickly. If I.

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Let's just add some contrast here, and we'll add some vibrance. Something like that. All right.

00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um. If I call this off.

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay, we're getting. We're certainly getting the blueness here of the sky. But.

00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The rest of the image I feel like is getting a bit too cool. I want to preserve some of that warmth of the sunlight.

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If I add some warmth.

00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: At some point we start to lose.

00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That blueness in the sky. It's still blue, but now I feel like it's too.

00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Warm. It's just a question of taste. It's a question of preference. It's a question of you being, you know, so.

00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Somewhere in there. If I find somewhere.

00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Where I'm happy using the global temperature. I'm happy.

00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: With the the uh.

00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Combination of warmth to coolness in the image. And for me, maybe I would go a little bit cooler here.

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Something like that. Then.

00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'm okay. However, if I can't find that balance, because for some reason.

00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I want the foreground to be cooler.

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But I feel like I'm losing a little bit of warmth in the sky. Then I would add a separate.

00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Filter to a separate mass to the sky. So here's an example.

00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I want the foreground to be a little bit cooler, just like you weigh down here.

00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But I want this to be a little bit warmer.

00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And just to make this simple.

00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I could do something like this.

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I'm just going to add, you know.

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Point 2.3 here.

00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Maybe 0 point 4.5 or 5. I'm sorry.

00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Right, something like that. And.

00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I still feel like I have.

00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Enough blue here. I still feel like I have.

00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The coolness, but I.

00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Added, or gained a little bit of warmth in the sky.

00:58:02.000 --> 00:58:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Of course this depends on the image. Every image is going to be different. Every situation is going to be different.

00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um. I also think it's nuanced. You have to be nuanced about it. If you exaggerate it, then, of course it it doesn't look right. It doesn't feel right. So you have to find.

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You have to find a balance, or I might, you know.

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This is one way to do it another way. That I've done it quite often is.

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um.

00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I will!

00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Warm it up like this.

00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Just a bit, all right. So now.

00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I like the way the sky looks.

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Everything is relative, too, you see. So.

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I might like the way the warmth in the sky looks, but I might feel like I've lost a little bit of the blue, because the foreground is also not cool enough.

00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I can do the same thing in reverse. Now I can.

00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um put a mask like this.

00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then I'm just going to.

00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Ever so slightly cool off my foreground.

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay. And when I cool off the foreground magically.

00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The cool, the the blues in the sky.

00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: All of a sudden feel a little bit bluer now than if I were to do this.

00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay.

00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:22.000
Mark Zelyony: I mean, I understand how to do it. Technically.

00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:26.000
Mark Zelyony: My problem is finding that balance you're constantly bringing up.

00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, well, that's.

00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, that's that's gonna be.

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know, that's going to be.

00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um, just using your judgment. That's the best I can, I can tell you, using your judgment.

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um, trusting your.

00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Your instincts right, if you, if you.

00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: There's no right or wrong if you feel that it could be a little bit cooler or warmer than.

00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I think it only gets it only starts to get.

00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: More um.

00:59:54.000 --> 01:00:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It only starts to get less subjective, more objective. When you start getting really close to the edges where you're really.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Making the whole thing cool or warm. Then you can start to say no, that I think that could be a little bit cooler.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Or a little bit warmer. But once you get inside that range where it's really going to be a feel thing where you're going to have to just sort of.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Make a judgment call. Then that's up to you. That's going to be something you have to decide on your own.

01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But I have seen people go, you know, exaggerate and make it.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Mark Zelyony: I constantly go get him over! Carried over, carried away, carried behind, carried beyond the borders.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Overly warm.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, yeah.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, yeah, well.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Mark Zelyony: And it looks good while I'm working on it. But then I step back and come back, and it looks totally ugly.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: No.

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Mark Zelyony: And then I need to more, more or less redo it from scratch, or like going like halfway back.

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Well, well, that's a good sign. That's a good sign. If it if you do it at first, st and then you come back to it the next day, and and it looks overdone.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That's a good sign. That means that that you're seeing it with fresh eyes, and you need to pull it back.

01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um. So I think all you know that's that's always a good thing. Or if I if you come back the next day, and you feel even more.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: More conviction about what you did. That's also a pretty good sign.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um. So I think the problem is, the danger is when you have a sense in your head, when you have this.

01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Sort of feeling that you should put it back, and you don't. That's.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That's the that's the I think that's the dangerous part, because then.

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:25.000
Mark Zelyony: That situation. Sometimes it happens to me that I completely drop that image.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Because, well, then, yeah, cause then you.

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, then you're leaving. You're leaving the warmth, or you're leaving the saturation in, because you think that.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: There's some other reason for it, right? You think that maybe it's just going to look better to the people, or you're going to get more attention, or what have you? So that's the part that you have to be a little bit careful about. But.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Listen to your, you know, if you've been doing. Oh, I think everyone here has been doing this for a while.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know. Listen to your own intuition.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If it's strong, if it's saying, I really think that it should be cooler. And then that's fine.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If you're not sure, then, of course, you know, you can get feedback and so forth.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:00.000
Mark Zelyony: And even speaking of that image you've used as an example.

01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:03.000
Mark Zelyony: You called off the foreground.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:09.000
Mark Zelyony: But in your case foreground was quite foreign, quite far away.

01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Mhm.

01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.000
Mark Zelyony: And you called cooled off the foreground.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:20.000
Mark Zelyony: But usually the foreground is warmer than the background because of the atmosphere between.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Well, sure, that's true.

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um, except that in my image that I showed you, the foreground is completely in shadow.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Right and so.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:30.000
Mark Zelyony: And it's like problem. Couple of miles away.

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But it's still completely in shadow. So the the light here, the the energy of the light, is in the sky.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: There's no direct light in the foreground.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.000
Mark Zelyony: Right.

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And so, yeah, so that's the difference. There, right?

01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Mark Zelyony: Okay, so this is why it feels better.

01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:45.000
Mark Zelyony: Called, then war.

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, yeah, I mean, the light, right? Light is, generally speaking, light is going to be where the warmth is right when we get sunrise when you go someplace for sunrise.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: As soon as that morning light hits.

01:02:55.000 --> 01:03:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Your building, or your structure, or your person, or your landscape.

01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That instantly gets warmer.

01:03:03.000 --> 01:03:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And in this case.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Well, let me put it to you this way right when you're at a sunrise or a sunset. What's the 1st thing to get warm. It's not the land, it's the sky.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:13.000
Mark Zelyony: The clouds.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Exactly, and so the sky gets warmer first.st

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And the land or the foreground tends to stay cool until the sun rises.

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And so in this case, I want to maintain that sense of expectation between the light that's coming in the sky.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And the foreground that's still waiting to get that light. So a lot of that has to do with what your picture is about, and.

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know what the what you're photographing. So the story you're trying to tell, I mean, we're back to, you know, back to that age-old question. So.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But great, that's great, good.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:43.000
Mark Zelyony: And the gap that.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Good questions.

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:46.000
Mark Zelyony: You brought me again to my to the beginning of my original question.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.000
Mark Zelyony: On the sunrise.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:53.000
Mark Zelyony: You have clouds which are relatively warm or so, or seriously warm.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:55.000
Mark Zelyony: But the sky.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
Mark Zelyony: Gets warmer, too.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Mark Zelyony: And if it gets warm.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:03.000
Mark Zelyony: It gets washed out and.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:07.000
Mark Zelyony: Technically. Yes, you can bring the blue part of the color of the sky back.

01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:13.000
Mark Zelyony: Questions, should you, or should you? How far? How far should you go with that.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: What do you think?

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:19.000
Mark Zelyony: You will say it's in balance, and I don't have that balance.

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'll keep. I'll keep asking you what you think until you tell me. All right.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:31.000
Mark Zelyony: Well, I have about at least 3 opinions, and I have a more or less serious serious question myself in.

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:33.000
Mark Zelyony: And those 3 guys fight inside me.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, well, you know.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Well, that that.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Mark Zelyony: And that's and 3 is low estimate.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, yeah, you have to get. You have to bring more peace and and cohesion inside. So you're more in line. You have 2 little guys in each shoulder. It's gonna be hard to edit images.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:39.000
Mark Zelyony: Sometimes I have more.

01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:40.000
David Tripp: So.

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So.

01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:56.000
David Tripp: To to slightly build on his question. Would you ever use some kind of a mask whatever? There's probably a lot of technical ways to do it.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:59.000
David Tripp: To warm up the blue part of the sky differently from the clouds.

01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, yeah, I mean again. Sure, sure, like, I.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um again. It depends on the situation right like I don't have.

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:11.000
David Tripp: Mhm.

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Generally speaking, my approach, my philosophy is.

01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The tools are there, and.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Whether I want to use them or not depends on the story I want to tell. So sometimes you need to go and use a mask.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: What I try to avoid, and what I.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: What I want to stress that you avoid is to fall into formulas, to fall into.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Oh, I got a sky. Let me create a mask for this or that. I got this. Let me do this or that. Everything should be, and this is harder, absolutely harder, for sure. But.

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I think you learn, and you.

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You learn, and it becomes more enjoyable, more meaningful, more fun.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: When you just approach each image.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: As its own thing, and you just.

01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Apply whatever tools you think it needs. So sure. There have been some images where.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:06:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um, I. The clouds are perfect, but the sky just isn't working right. And so maybe I'll use some color range thing or something to.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Add something to the blue part of the sky. Absolutely. But that's because I felt that image needed it.

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Some other images. It doesn't need it. Right? It's okay.

01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um. I like to blur the edges right, because blurring the edges is where you kind of come up with new, interesting things.

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Instead of everything being very defined, and I.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000
David Tripp: Right.

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That to me gets it gets boring after a while.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um, so, you know. Keep it, keep it always flowing and and and.

01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Go into each image just like you go into the landscape right? You don't know what you're gonna what you're going to find. You don't know. You don't not sure what to. You know what what you're going to discover.

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But it should be a discovery, and.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And we'll end with this.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Even after everything I just said about each image.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Being what you're what you're a new sort of experience, a new sort of.

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Way to learn. You have to. You have well.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I rarely say you have to, but I will say it now. You have to connect that back to.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: What you were doing in the field.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You have to. Otherwise you're just going to be.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um. Well, it's gonna be much harder for you to actually.

01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Find a sort of method.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That connects what you are responding to in the field that connects who you are, that connects what interests you.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You're gonna have a harder time connecting that to the editing.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: There's no consistency there, whereas when I edit an image, the 1st thing I ask myself is.

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Wow! What was I thinking? What would? What did that feel like? What was it like? And I don't really ask myself that I look at the image, and I remember because that's why I pressed the shutter button.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Well I remember that when I made this image I just had this sense of the clouds above the landscape and the light, and it just had this sort of.

01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um, you know this this magical sort of ethereal feel to it kind of dreamy.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Well, that now gives me a sense of how I should go about editing the image instead of starting from scratch.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Starting from scratch is kind of like someone giving you their images to edit it for them.

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Whereas if you're adding your images, you got the history, you're the one that was there with the camera in the field, making a picture.

01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Use that as your basis. To then.

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Move forward with the editing, and I think that's a much better.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And more creative way to edit your images.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: All right. Everyone thanks very much. It's been another great session.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000
Mark Zelyony: Thank you.

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And don't forget this. Wednesday is our feedback session.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So you can upload your images to the link that I sent in the email. There'll be another email that you get tomorrow with another link. And and yeah, we'll have fun on Wednesday.

01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Looking at some images and seeing what you guys are up to.

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000
Mark Zelyony: Okay. Thank you.

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: All right. Thanks, everyone. Take care!

01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:42.000
David Tripp: Thank you.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:44.000
Mike Plotczyk: Thanks, Robert.
