00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
vkolstad’s iPad: From the end of the rock right now.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
vkolstad’s iPad: That's pretty cool. That adds a little.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
vkolstad’s iPad: Little to it, little little flare, you know it's nice.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
vkolstad’s iPad: Like the fact that you know that he wasn't working. Nothing was going on there.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Welcome, everyone! Welcome to another!

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Creative path, Academy, session. This is number.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: 31 today.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It's titled lightroom updates and workflow originally was going to be.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Just a workflow.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Session. Essentially, that's where I.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Take you through a couple of images and show you how I'm thinking about editing them, and.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: At the same time not only exploring my sort of thought process, but also.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Using lightroom and using it in different ways and.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Understanding it better, but I thought I would add also add, in.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The updates that lightroom has had in the last 2 versions.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That have been updated fairly recently. So I'm talking about.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Version 14.4.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And 14.5.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So 14.4 came out.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Maybe a month and a half ago something like that and 14.5 came out.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A week or 2 ago, so I figured I'd go through those. I know. I've had questions from members in terms of what the updates are whether we should pay attention to them.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: What's relevant, what's not relevant.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So I thought I'd take you through those.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Tonight, and of course I'm always open to questions. You might have.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: There was also a question from Steve. I believe.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Recently he wanted me to go over the.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Sharpening adjustments in lightroom.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Specifically. You know the the controls. There.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Amount, radius, detail, and masking.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And that's always not the easiest thing, I think, to intuit. It can be a little bit counterintuitive.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And actually have a little graphic that I created to maybe explain that a little bit better.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So, yeah, thanks everyone for joining me today second time this week. So it's great to be back.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um doing and talking about what I love.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Alan, Carl Harry Helen.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Howard. Jean Marie welcome Jeff.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Joanne, Karen.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Welcome, Mike! Welcome, Mildred, Patricio.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Steve. Welcome, Tamara.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Welcome, Tom, on your ipad and Virginia on your ipad. Awesome.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So hopefully. You can see everything.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Hopefully, you've got a 12, 9, or a 13, and not an 11, otherwise it may be tough to see a little bit of the details.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In lightroom.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I've muted everyone as usual in these sessions, but of course you can easily unmute yourself if you want to.

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Ask a question, or.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Give me some feedback, or make a comment.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Again. You can do that by pressing the spacebar.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: On your computer that should unmute your mic. Otherwise.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Just click on the microphone, icon to get rid of the little red line.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You're more than free and welcome to chime in whenever you like. I just meet everybody at the start in case there's.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Background noise is something that we're not aware of. Sometimes we don't know.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Also you can leave comments in the chat as well.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I now have a red sticker that tells me to look there all the time, so hopefully.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I will see all your comments when you leave them.

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Apologies in the past, Dave, I haven't seen them.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I usually won't email you or leave it in the in the session replay notes on the website. If it's something that you were asking me about.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay, so.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Let's get started. So I'm going to go through these updates. And then at the end of that.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know, if you'd like to ask any questions or whatever, you're more than free to.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So some of these updates again came in 14 4. Some came in 14 5. I don't exactly remember which.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Ones, or didn't actually note them down. But.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: We'll talk about those. So.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So the 1st one is just basically improvements to the AI generative. AI.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'm not surprised by that.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: AI in general is moving at a very rapid pace.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And so I'm I'm not surprised. That lightroom or adobe, I should say, is improving the algorithm. So this update that they've made.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It's supposed to be faster, more precise, etc. So let me show you an example of something that I found.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Was a little bit difficult before.

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So here's an image.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And let me expand this a little bit.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um.

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Bring this down here.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay. So here's an image. And there's this.

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: When I actually made this image, I was actually trying to move a little bit to my left.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To avoid this light, here.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That I didn't want in the image in the picture, but I just couldn't get in the angle that I wanted, and so.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That's the image that I captured. And I had actually tried to remove this before this update with.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: With the AI. And wasn't that great.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So let's try it again with this new feat, with, just with this new update, I'm going to press Q.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And that um.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Takes me into the remove tool. I'm going to click on the.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Mode here to highlight the generative. AI make sure generative AI is checked.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And this detect objects.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It's hit or miss. Basically, what that does is that if you encircle.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The thing you want to remove.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It will automatically detect it.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Sometimes it works sometimes, and not so precise. I'm not going to use that. I'm just going to actually draw it in. So.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Again. I want to remove this light here.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And the metal piece. That's.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Holding it. We'll start with that.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So I'm going to do this.

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Something like that.

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then, once you have your.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Area selected. Then I'm going to come over here to the right and click on. Remove.

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And depending on your computer.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know. That's how fast it'll work.

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And you see it did a really good job, particularly with the.

00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Buildings in the back. So I want to make sure that the buildings in the back still look.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Correct. Right? Nothing looks weird.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And so, if you notice, if I.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Take this off. You see the building in the back. It's just a simple structure here.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Nothing fancy, and if I redo that um.

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Effect again. Let's try it a second time.

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And this time I'm going to go a little bit further. So I'm going to actually come.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Do the light again. But I'm gonna actually come down here and.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Let's let's let's give it a challenge here. So I'm going to remove the whole.

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Lamp post, or whatever it is that's holding up that light here.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And there's even a little wire that comes down.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That way. A little cable.

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And let's see what that does.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah. So that's I would say, that's definitely better.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You can see that it it removed everything, kept it clean.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And so that's that's a big improvement. I think over what's happening there. Now, let's say that. And again, many of you probably know this, but let's say that you.

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You um!

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Enable it, you ask it to remove, and you're not quite happy with the results. You do get some.

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You have 2 options here. One is. You can go through some variations.

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And so you see that here.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This is variation number one. I can click on this right arrow.

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And this will give me variation. 2.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then variation 3, and it's actually changing the buildings in the back and making them look different.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But variation. One for me is the one that looks closest. Now let's say you go through all 3 variations.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And you're still not happy with it. Then you can ask it to regenerate it again. And so you just come down here to the generate button.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And it'll do the process again if I click on. Generate now.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It will, you know, make another attempt.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And so now this is a little worse, because it's put this.

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Light building here that wasn't there before.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And that's again a little bit better.

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But even now this structure doesn't look quite the same.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So I'm going to undo that. And I kind of like the way it was. The original version.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: All right. So that's the um.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The enhanced or the improved generative. AI. And again, I expect this to continue to improve.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: As as time goes on.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay. Another.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Feature that I think might be useful to some of you is.

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um when you're copying and pasting.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Settings from one image to another, or when you're syncing settings from one image to another.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So let me show you what I mean by that. Here I have 2 images.

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And they're both very similar.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And so I have this image here, and the next one over here.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Just slightly different, but more or less the same image.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Shot within a couple of seconds of each other.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Now, if let's say I do a crop to this image, I'm going to press R.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And let's assume that I do.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'm going to crop this into a square format.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So I'll say one to one.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Something like that.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I want to apply that same crop.

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To this image over here. So there's 2 ways to do that.

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I can select this image.

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Select the one next to it, and then click on sync settings. Here at the bottom, right.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And in the past you would have.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: All of the different.

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Develop settings that you could sync from one image to the other, and you could.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Check none, and then just select one or 2 or 3 that you want to sync over.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Or you can check all, and it would sync everything over.

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But if let's say, you had some specific settings that you wanted to sync over. So, for example, in this case.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Let's say I just want to sync the crop.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I don't want to change anything else in the other. It means I just want to sink the crop from one to the other.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Well, I would click, check none here.

00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then I would select crop.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And underneath the crop is straightened angle and aspect, ratio.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Let's say I want those as well. I would click on, synchronize, and it would sync it over.

00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The addition now, or the what lightroom has added is the ability to save that as a preset.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So save any.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Potential settings that you want to synchronize from one image to the other, or copy and paste.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: As a preset, and so, if I have this selected here, I can come down here, and I already. You see, I already have it saved as crop.

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But let's let's delete it. So I'm going to delete that.

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So I'm going to do it again.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Check none, then select crop.

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And so this is all that I want to sync over. But I want to save this as a preset. So in the future I don't have to.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Do this, check none and select the 2 things. I can just select my preset. So down here I'm going to come down here where it says.

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Custom subset click on save.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And type in crop. They're calling it a subset of all of the adjustment settings that you could.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Synchronize.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And click, create.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: All right. And so now that's saved as a preset. So let's do this again.

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If I select this image, and I want to.

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Synchronize it, just the crop to the other one.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Click on sync settings.

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And you see again everything is selected.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Now, all I have to do is click on here and select crop.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And that just selects the crop settings that I saved before you notice that I have another one here called Basic.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This means just synchronize the basic settings.

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So if I select basic. Now, you see that only the basic settings.

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Are selected to be synced over.

00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Now I mentioned before, you could do this as synchronize or copy and paste.

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So, for example.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If I select this image.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And right click, and I can come down to develop settings.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Copy settings.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And once again, what do you want to copy.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I can.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If I have these subsets saved, or if you have these subsets saved, I could say, copy the crop.

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then I hit copy.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And now I can actually apply this to multiple images. So, for example, let's say that I want it.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This image here to maintain all of its settings.

00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Except I wanted to crop it to a square format.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I would. Right click.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Develop settings.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Paste settings.

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And you see that it gets cropped to a square, because those are the settings that I copied before. Just the crop.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'm going to click on command Z. To undo that.

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay, so that's the.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Another feature. Again, being able to save these subsets and.

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I can imagine. This might be useful. For instance.

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If you.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Going to click on develop copy settings.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Again, you know, you can say, let's say that there's certain settings that you.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Normally copy over crop for me is one I may want to crop other images the same way.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If they're let's say, let's say that I have 5 images.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I want them all to be panoramas. Maybe I'll save.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That as a subset, just the cropping for panorama.

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um another one could be your.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Curve. So if you've got a specific.

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Contrast curve that you want to copy over.

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Then you can save that here just a curve.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And that would be copying it from the image that you're currently.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Uh editing.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then you can just save that and call it.

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know, curve or contrast, curve or whatever you like.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And let's go back here. I'm going to press R, and then click on, reset.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To reset my crop on that image.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay. Another little feature that you might want to look into from a performance standpoint is that if we go.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Come up into the lightroom preferences.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
Jean-Marie Mayas: Robert, may I interrupt you for a second? Please.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And of course.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:16.000
Jean-Marie Mayas: Before you leave the crop. The synchronization. At what level? At what level is this setting being synchronized or copied? For example, if we know it's a crop that's the highest level. But the dimensions of that crop.

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, yeah.

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:25.000
Jean-Marie Mayas: Is that the actual dimensions also, Carrie? So if you crop limit, say 10%, is it gonna do a 10% crop crop next time, or just a square.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: No. So let's try it. Okay, that's a great question. So let's say.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I don't think it matters whether it's a square or not. But let's say we crop in something like this.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Right.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So we've cropped keeping the aspect ratio but cropping in, you know, whatever that was 20% into the image, right? So we got 80% of the image left.

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So now I would select this image.

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I'm going to say.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Or I can select this image over here. Say, sync settings.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I'm going to select my subset crop.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I've already saved it.

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Click on, synchronize.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And it's it's cropping in exactly. Not only the aspect ratio, but the amount that you've cropped.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Is that what you're asking.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000
Jean-Marie Mayas: Okay, thank you. Uh-huh.

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, yeah, great. So, um.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So if you crop in 50%, you know, then everything you synchronize is going to be cropped in 50%. It's going to crop exactly the crop that you gave your source image as as if it were, as it were.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay.

00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay, um, right? So back in the.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Preferences.

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um if we come over to the performance. Tab.

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You see, there's a new entry here.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So right here you'll see.

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Right there. There's a new entry, and that says.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Enable or use Gpu for preview generation. So before, it was just use graphics processor and I would set this to auto.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: There's another one called Usegpu for Preview generation.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This will probably be set to auto, but you want to double check that. It's set to auto unless your computer is really slow or you don't have.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A good graphics processor. But if you do, you want this set to auto? And what this basically does is.

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If if you've ever had the experience where you're scrolling through a folder of images that are.

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Not recent or older. It'll take a little while for lightroom to.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Display the previews or get like, you know, if I'm.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Scrolling through something like this.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know. Sometimes you get gray boxes, and then they'll eventually we'll show you like. Here we go like that. See these gray boxes because it has to build the preview.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And that's supposed to improve this rendering of the preview. So the preview is built faster.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So you notice that when I scroll down there it was blank for a little while, so let's go here.

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay. And it takes.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A couple of seconds and boom! There you go!

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In the past that was a little bit slower, and that could be frustrating if you were scrolling through a lot of images. So they've added now.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: They've given lightroom the ability to use your graphics processor.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: On your in your computer to generate these previews.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You can turn that off, but I think auto is the best bet auto probably means we'll use it unless.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It's actually degrading the performance of lightroom in general.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: All right. So that's a little performance. Improvement.

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That that we get, and that's again in the preferences in the performance. Tab.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay. Now, here's another one that I've.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Talked about already. But I'm going to.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Just talk about it again.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So in the past. Here's an image that is.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Shot at Iso 400.

00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It's not terribly noisy, but it does have noise.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And if I go into the detail panel here.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And if I zoom in.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Alright, this is at a hundred percent. But I'm going to come up here and click on.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The zoom for 300 to go in tighter.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And you can see that I have a fair bit of noise. You can see that in the sky.

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And in the past, if I wanted to use, I could remove the noise in 2 ways.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I could come over to the detail panel here in the detail panel here on the right.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I could use the luminance. Slider.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To reduce noise.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And so you see that as I increase this.

00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The noise gets better. It's.

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Less than it was before, same thing with the color.

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But this is manual, and it can only take you so far before you start to.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Get some artifacts. Things like, you know.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The image is going to get a little soft, because.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Noise. Reduction is essentially softening the image.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So the other way that we would reduce noise would be to use the enhance function.

00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: We would right click on it, and we would click on enhance.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The problem with that was that in the past that would that would.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Duplicate our raw file, it would apply the enhanced function.

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The Denoise function to the raw file, but it would create a second raw file, so you would wind up with.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A, your original source file.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Plus a duplicated raw file that had the enhance feature, and you essentially had 2 files, one with the noise reduction, one without.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And sometimes there was a question about whether I should keep the one that doesn't have the noise reduction, for whatever reason. Well.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: They've now made that a.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A mood point, because now in the detail panel here, panel, we have a.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Checkbox that allows us to apply Denoise.

00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And if I check this it'll.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Take a little while couple of seconds depending on how fast your computer is.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And this applies the Denoise without.

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Creating an additional file.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And you can also also uncheck this whenever you like, if you want to remove the Denoise. So now, if you notice, we zoom in.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Notice that it's much cleaner. Now.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And we haven't used the manual noise reduction, and we can also.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Uncheck this or recheck it. In addition, we also have a little slider here.

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: We had the Slider before, but you had to commit to the amount of Denoise before you actually created that second file. Now, it's all non-destructive.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So they've basically made it completely non-destructive. We can.

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Reduce that little that Denoise, or increase it even more.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: For greater Denoise. And of course, with Denoise you also get what's called raw details.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And that's just another algorithm. That lightroom, that lightroom applies to your image.

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To bring out a little bit.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To get a little bit more fidelity out of the raw file.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: When you use the Denoise I'm I'm imagining or assuming, based on what I've seen, that it just applies a slight, a bit slight bit of sharpening.

00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To give you an image that looks like nothing has been applied to it except the noise is gone.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Alright, so very, very nice feature. And if you notice, there's also the super resolution here.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Which is also pretty amazing. It means that.

00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: We can double the size of our image.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And yet we can uncheck that to go back to the original size again. So again, they've made the enhanced feature completely non-destructive.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You can't use Denoise and super resolution at the same time. Unfortunately. So if I click on super resolution.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You'll notice that the Denoise and the raw details is now grayed out.

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But.

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Our resolution has doubled both in the height and the width.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And so that means that if this image was originally.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I believe it was 20 megapixels.

00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Now it's 80 megapixels. But if you don't want that, or you want to apply Denoise, and not the super resolution you can uncheck this.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And notice that our resolution drops by half. Now we're.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Half width, half the height, the original.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And you can apply the Denoise.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And get the Denoise feature. So.

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I think that's a huge improvement. It makes this process of denoising and resizing much more.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Well, it makes it non-destructive, and I think a lot easier.

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000
Helen Marriott: Yeah, Robert, could I ask?

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And Jeff. Jeff. I'm sorry Jeff was asking.

00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I think I just answered that question. Yes, you can only do one or the other. You can do Denoise with raw details.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Or super resolution.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:21.000
Helen Marriott: Robert, just yeah. Just following up on that, could we? Could we go into that detail panel and use.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Was there a question.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah.

00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:28.000
Helen Marriott: Denoise first, st and then go out of the panel and then come back to the detail panel and then add.

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:30.000
Helen Marriott: And super resolution.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So that yeah, they they are check boxes. Right? So I was just thinking about this before. Let's say that I want to print this image really large.

00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:33.000
Helen Marriott: Or not.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay. Um.

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: We're not going to get Denoise right? So we would have to if we wanted one image. That was.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Large that we wanted to print that large. I could uncheck this right now.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I could click on super resolution.

00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And when I'm using super resolution I lose the ability to add the Denoise. But I could still use the manual noise reduction here to reduce some of the noise.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000
Helen Marriott: Uh-huh.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay. And then let's say that I went ahead. And you know this is, this is pretty good. I mean it's not. It's not as I don't think it's as good as a denoise, but it's definitely less noise.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Now I could go ahead and print this, and I could print it large.

00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Now, after I've done my print, I say, Okay, now, I want.

00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To export it, or I want to print it small, so I don't need the super resolution. But I'd like to take advantage of the Denoise. Well.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: We come back to the image.

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Go into the detail panel.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Uncheck the super resolution.

00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then check the Denoise.

00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000
Helen Marriott: Yeah, yeah, thank you.

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay? So yeah, it's always available. Always non-destructive.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You don't commit to anything. When you check those boxes they can always be unchecked at any time.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:50.000
steve guercia: Rob, can you do one of them in lightroom and then move.

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.000
steve guercia: The the raw into Photoshop and do the other one in Photoshop.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um, no, because.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Both of these algorithms, Denoise and super resolution are being applied to the raw file.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And so once you make one of these adjustments, or once you apply one of these algorithms to the raw file.

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You can't apply the other, and the raw file has.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The you know it. When you apply it, it.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Has a flag that this has been applied. So once you open it up in Photoshop, it'll say, well, you've already applied, Denoise, if you want to do separate resolution, you have to uncheck.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The Denois. So when you open it up in Photoshop, in camera, raw.

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You will also have the same checkboxes.

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Now, if you open it up in Photoshop as a tiff file. Well, yeah, you can super. You can upsize it there. But you're no longer using a raw file. You're just upsizing a Photoshop file.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Does that make sense.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.000
steve guercia: Yeah, it does. I was just wondering if it was. There was an easy way to fool it.

00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, yeah, to cheat. Yeah, yeah, to cheat. Unfortunately. Um, I don't think there is. Yeah, to get around it.

00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know. Maybe in the future they'll have the ability to use.

00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Both at the same time, Denoise and super resolution. That would be ideal. So let's let's see.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Let's see what happens in the future.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay, just a few little minor things.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Maybe I'll just explain this very quickly.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If you um.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay, so your your images in catalog, your all of your raw files in your lightroom catalog. The adjustments are saved in the catalog.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That means that if, for whatever unfortunate reason, your catalog.

00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Gets corrupt or deleted, or anything like that.

00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Then you would lose.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The adjustments that you made to your images, you would still have your raw files. Assuming that you didn't lose those.

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But if you somehow lost your catalog.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You could re-import your images into a new catalog, but you would not have the adjustments unless.

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Unless you had one of these 2 conditions.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The 1st condition is, if you.

00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Had converted all of your raw files to Dng files.

00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Because the Dng file format.

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Saves the adjustments to the, to the images.

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So that's 1 example. So in this case, this image is a an Orf image. That means it's my Olympus.

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: From Olympus camera, and because it's not a Dng file.

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I wouldn't have the adjustments for this image if I lost my catalog.

00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Whereas if I went to an image like this, this is a dng.

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The dng format.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Also saves the adjustments that you make in lightroom into the file itself.

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And so, if I imported this file into a different catalog, my adjustments would be there now, I said there were 2 conditions.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That's 1 condition converting to Dng.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The second condition.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That would allow you to avoid. This, perhaps, is, if you turned on the.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Xmp, sidecar function.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Basically, what that means is that if you turn this on and where you find this is on a per catalog basis.

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Where you find this is.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If you come up to your lightroom menu, and then you come down to catalog settings.

00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: On windows. I think it's in the file. Menu.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If you come down to the catalog settings you'll see here. The 3rd tab is metadata.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And there is a an option here.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Automatically write changes into Xmp.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: What this means is that if I turn this on, if I click this.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That means that lightroom will add a little file.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To a little sister, file, if you will, to every one of your raw files.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And that little sister file it's called. It's basically the name of your raw file, dot Xmp at the end.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And that little file holds all of the adjustments that you made.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That you make actually.

00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That you've made, and you will make. It'll save those adjustments into that file.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Now the reason why I have this off, and why a lot of folks have it off is because.

00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Remember now, every time you make an adjustment in lightroom.

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It writes that adjustment into the lightroom catalog.

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But if you also have this checked, it also has to write it into that little file. So it's writing it twice. It's writing it into the catalog. And it's writing the change.

00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Into this file. And of course.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That can potentially.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Affect your performance. It could slow lightroom down, and so, by turning this off.

00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You're essentially avoiding that second writing of the adjustments. And so.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: For me. I have this off because.

00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Essentially I do a lot of backups of my catalog, and so if my catalog gets corrupt, I can always go back to a backup.

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If you. You know this is in the event that you completely lost your catalog.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: What this new update does is that if you turn this on, it basically makes that.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Process, a little bit more efficient.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So it will pause doing that while you're working on something intense in lightroom. So lightroom doesn't slow down, and as soon as you stop using lightroom.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Then it'll make those changes, and that essentially, is supposed to improve the editing speed and sort of the.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The responsiveness of lightroom.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay, so hopefully, that just gives you an overview of.

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Dng files, one of the benefits of of make, of converting to Dng.

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: One of the benefits of using this Xmp feature, and one of the disadvantages, which is that it will affect performance.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I guess the at the end of the day, if you don't.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Use this, and just make sure that you're backing up your catalog regularly.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know you can set it to remind you once a week.

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And if anything happens you can always retrieve a previous catalog. That's no longer, you know.

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That isn't that old? And you may just have lost a few edits to a few images.

00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah.

00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:37.000
Jean-Marie Mayas: Quick question, is there a a reason, I mean a rationale for toggling that.

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:43.000
Jean-Marie Mayas: Xmp on a file, specific or image specific basis rather than.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:45.000
Jean-Marie Mayas: Doing it all the time.

00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Well, I don't think I could be mistaken here. I don't think that you can.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Enable this on a per image basis unless you have it turned on here, and if you turn it on here.

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This will apply to all of your images in your catalog. So.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If I would have turned this on here now.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.000
Jean-Marie Mayas: Alright!

00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, if I were to turn this on, not only would it write this little Xmp sidecar file.

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To basically would write that file to every image in my catalog, even an image that I haven't edited for years.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.000
Jean-Marie Mayas: Got it.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It would go through my entire catalog and and write it out. Now, that may take a little.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Time upfront. Let's let's assume that it did that, and it was done.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Then when you open up lightroom again, it's not doing anything until you make an adjustment to an image, and when you make an adjustment to one image, it would then write it out to that image.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay.

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, so.

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The reason for using this. If you're.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Let's just say you're maybe a little bit paranoid. You want to make sure that you always have your adjustments. You could turn that on.

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Again. If you back up your catalog and you have a.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know, a robust backup system.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Meaning. You're backing it up locally, and you're hopefully backending up in another location or into the cloud.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Then I've never, ever lost my catalog, where I completely lost all my images.

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The worst that's ever happened to me is, I had to retrieve a catalog that was a couple of days old because it would corrupt, and I went back a couple of days, and I really didn't lose much at all.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And this was years ago hasn't happened recently at all.

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay. Just 2 more things. Here. Um.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Or I guess one more thing, which is, they've added.

00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Well, actually, 2 things. One is minor. They just improve the ability for lightroom to detect duplicate images.

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This is something that used to bug me before. So if you.

00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Import images into lightroom.

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then you rename those images.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Alright. So let's say you rename them when you're importing them.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then you use that same.

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Camera card to import new images. Lightroom might get confused.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Because it doesn't see the same name of the images that you already imported, because you renamed them, and it might import those images again.

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And now you have duplicates with different names.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This new feature that they've added, or this upgrade is that now it actually will detect. If you've renamed an image.

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So this way, it basically more robust way of making sure that you don't import.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A duplicate image, even if the name has changed, or you've renamed the image.

00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: From what it was on your camera card.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And the last little thing that they added is.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The ability to filter.

00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Now you can filter by.

00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Any of the AI options.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So what do what do I mean by that? Well.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If we open up the filter bar here at the top.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I'm going to go to all photographs, so we can have a larger selection of images to filter by.

00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I come up here to Metadata.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I'm just going to go to and to the 1st column. Okay? And we have the typical.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Ways to filter. We can filter by date, month, day, file, type, etc.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This is very powerful. So you should definitely play with this if you haven't, because it allows you to really filter down your.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Cataloged by many, many different.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Uh.

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Different types of metadata. But if we come here to develop.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay. You'll see now that they've added a few, which is.

00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Has AI remove so filter by images that you've actually used the AI remove on.

00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Filter by Denoise or raw details, or has super resolution.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So if I select, has super resolution.

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This will filter down.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: My um!

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Catalog by 3 images that have the super resolution applied.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay, and no, is the remaining images.

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If I come here, and I say filter by images that has Denoise.

00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Then I have all these images that have the Denoise.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Applied.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So just a way of filtering down by the AI adjustments you you see here. You also have.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Has raw detail. So resolution has point, color.

00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Has, and of course, the removal, the different removal functions, including the AI remove.

00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Also has lens. Blur has AI mask, has masking.

00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Has AI mask is different from the normal masking. AI mask is, if you've applied one of the AI masks like.

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The sky mask, or the.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Person mask, or things like that.

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This will filter down your catalog down to the images that has that applied so.

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Maybe there's a reason why you may want to do that.

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know, you want to see which images you've used the Denoise, or things like that again. Just another way.

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To filter down your images.

00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um. And another cool thing is that if I click on, has Denoise.

00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So uh.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You notice that I have here? Yes and no. So yes is. Yes, I've used Denoise. And then over here it'll show you which cameras.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I used on the images that have Denoise. So I've got.

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know, 29 from my canon.

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Canon one Ds. Mark Iii. That doesn't surprise me, because that's my noisiest camera.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And it's a 12 year old camera. And so I've used Denoise the most on images from that camera, because they were the noisiest and.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know honestly a lot of these images that you'll see here that I applied Denoise to were images that I had sort of discarded.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Because I thought that. You know I shot them, maybe at Iso, 800 or 1,200, and it was just so noisy that I said. I can't use them.

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But this is why. And I've been asked this question before. This is why I never, almost never delete images unless they are blatantly.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Mistakes right? But I never delete images because of this very reason. A lot of a lot of these images, especially older ones.

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I thought that I would never be able to use them. Really.

00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To print because they were just too noisy. Well, guess what.

00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I went back and said, Hey, wait a second. Let me try this, Denoise.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I was able to. I don't want to say salvage, but make them usable.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And so you never know what updates lightroom is going to bring in the future or any other raw developer, and.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Because I've maintained that image in the raw, in the raw format.

00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I can take advantage of these improvements in the raw format. That's another reason why I like to keep.

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: As my images as much as possible in the raw format, and not use external plugins. I convert them to Psd. Or tiff, because.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Those file formats don't.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Will not probably have the same potential to be improved into the future. The way raw does, because raw.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Is essentially a digital format.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That we can apply better and better algorithms to, whereas a Pst file has already been baked.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Into a visible pixel.

00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And that's much, much harder to improve into the future.

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:56.000
Jean-Marie Mayas: Robert, could those filters be? Um? Can you apply concurrently multiple filters? Is this one at a time?

00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:00.000
Jean-Marie Mayas: Can you select multiple filters and then have them applied concurrently.

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Well um.

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Multiple filters, but they're going to be subsets of each one. So, for example, you see that I have 4 columns here.

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So I can keep applying filters, but they're subsets. So, for example.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So far I've got images that have Denoise. Yes, then I've.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Filtered that down to.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Just images from this camera. And then I can actually filter down to a particular lens.

00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So now I've got.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Images shot with this lens.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: From this camera that have Denoise.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay.

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.000
Jean-Marie Mayas: Right. But in the prior screen.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.000
Jean-Marie Mayas: The prior selection.

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:40.000
Jean-Marie Mayas: Not this one. There was a prior filter selection.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um prior filter.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:45.000
Jean-Marie Mayas: If you go back a couple. Yeah, if you go back a couple of screens.

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um.

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Filter, so.

00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:54.000
Jean-Marie Mayas: The filter options. Yeah, the the options of the filters. When you 1st saw the AI.

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Oh, I'm sorry. Yes, you mean where I'm selecting.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Which which one I want to start with. You're saying.

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.000
Jean-Marie Mayas: Correct, correct.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: No one at a time.

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, one at a time, so you can't. You can't do 2 at a time.

00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I mean you could do 2 at a time if yeah. Well, so let's try it this way. If you.

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Said, here, develop, has Denoise.

00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay. Then here you can come.

00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:18.000
Jean-Marie Mayas: That. Yeah, that was what I was talking about. The sub under the develop.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yes, yes, I'm sorry. Yeah. Under the develop here you do not have any more. But.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You could set. You got to start with some filter. So let's say, has Denoise. Now this just came this just.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Was set to camera. But I could change this. I can change this from camera to.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.000
Jean-Marie Mayas: Okay.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To date.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So now I would have. Yes, and what dates did I shoot the Denoise with right, or what date are the images that I have? Denoise applied to.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Or I can change this to file type.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: All right. So there are 4. There are 11 raw files and.

00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: 44 dng files.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I could change this to.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Aperture. So yeah, you can.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Apply multiple filters, but they are in in series, not in parallel.

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:06.000
Jean-Marie Mayas: Ryan. There seem to be 4 criteria available on this screen. Is it? Is it 4.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That's total. Yeah. So 4 columns. So you can. You can each each one of these columns. You can change.

00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:09.000
Jean-Marie Mayas: Okay. Okay.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The different filtering.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.000
Jean-Marie Mayas: Okay.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And one more thing I'll add, while we're talking about filtering, is that let's say you set up a pretty.

00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Complex, filter, here, so.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I want to filter for images with Denoise.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: On a particular camera.

00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Shot on a particular lens. Let's say.

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You can save that as a preset, so you don't have to.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Constantly select all of those, and the way you save that is right up here.

00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In the right up here.

00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You can click on custom filter.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And you can say, save current preset, save current settings as a new preset.

00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And you see that I've got a bunch of presets that I've saved here already.

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: These presets configure these 4 columns in different ways.

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And so I click on save current settings as a new preset, and I can say.

00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know. Uh.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Has the noise.

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Canon and hit, create.

00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And now you see that that's saved. If I click on, you know.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Camera info that reconfigures this to show me camera information. I can come back and click on. That has the noise.

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Here, and we come back to the previous configuration. So you can save many of these filters as presets to be able to move through them very quickly and find whatever you want. This is the.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I've talked about this many times. This is the power of the metadata in Lightroom.

00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It's way way more powerful than having things saved in folders and subfolders on your hard drive, because you can.

00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Manipulate this virtually in an infinite amount of ways. And yet you're never moving anything on your hard drive or renaming things, or.

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: etc.

00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay. So the last thing I wanted to talk about here is.

00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Go through the.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'll go through a workflow, an image workflow, just to give you a sense of.

00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: My thought process on the image, and then we'll do sharpening. And I'll talk about sharpening specifically.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So here's an image that I made recently in New York City. I think I showed a print of this.

00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: On Monday in our last print lab.

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But this was just a.

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Kind of walking through the street. It was a foggy day in the city. Hudson, yards down in on the west side of Manhattan.

00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And this fog was just.

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Hanging over the buildings.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I just loved the shapes and the.

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Sort of the tonal variation here.

00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I wasn't. I didn't really know what I was going to do with it, whether I would make it black and white or not, but I just liked the sort of the quality of the the feel of the image.

00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And very quickly I decided I wanted to go black and white, because it just made it much more graphic. I already had a very.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Sort of graphic idea in mind. It wasn't about.

00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Buildings in New York City. It was about just these shapes receding into the fog.

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So here's here's a i would say, a rare instance where.

00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Black and white was already in my mind. So I'm going to try black and white, because I don't really need the color.

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I want something much more.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Abstract.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So I'm going to come up here and.

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Into the basic panel, and I'm going to switch to apple pro raw monochrome. So this I made on my iphone because I was on my way to the Javits center to do a talk. And I had my phone. And that's all I really had time for.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And and so I shot this in raw. I.

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Use a dedicated app on my iphone called Pro camera.

00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Because if I open that up it's set to shoot in raw. I don't have to start manipulating and looking for settings.

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So it just it just gets me right into shooting mode.

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Versus the regular camera app that I have set up for candids and.

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: My dog and family, and so forth.

00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Not that I couldn't have done it with the built-in camera app, but.

00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I just like the just get into the into the.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Raw mode as quickly as possible.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay, so.

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Black and white.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'm going to increase the exposure a bit.

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I think it was a little bit in the dark side.

00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I'm I'm looking for something much more open.

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And much more, much more dynamic. Okay?

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Let's set my white point here.

00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And again, White Point, here is going to be sort of a judgment, because if I take this all the way to White well, there's white there.

00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It's a little bit I don't want to blow that out so.

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Let's bring this down. I'm going to leave it around here.

00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Maybe a little bit less. In fact, that's a little bit too light. So that's why you have to be careful with White Point. If I take this too high, it doesn't look like it's fog. It looks like it's something else.

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And it should be a little bit grayer. So let's leave the white pointer on there, for now.

00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'll bring down my blacks.

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I don't want to go too too deep with these, so let's stay around here again. Sometimes I will use these.

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Precisely like this.

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And sometimes I won't. I'll just sort of.

00:47:09.000 --> 00:47:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Play with them to get a feel, knowing that when I get towards the end of the editing.

00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'm going to revisit these to make sure that I really really am optimizing my tones. Here.

00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In the histogram, but for now, maybe I'm just trying to get a feel for where the image is going to go, and.

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Sort of the idea that I have in mind, and where and to see whether I'm actually moving in that direction or not.

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um. I'm going to add some contrast here. I'm going to add a fair bit of contrast.

00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I'm going to jump down to Dehaze.

00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And add a bit of dehase in.

00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I think, and now it's coming back to me.

00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: D Hayes.

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Sort of controlled the haze in the image more, and gave it more of a.

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Three-dimensional feel. So let me show you what I mean.

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So I'm going to increase the dehaze, and I'm going to go pretty aggressive here.

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So something like that.

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So that's without the dehaze. That's with the dehaze. And notice that the dehaze.

00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Takes a little way, takes a little bit of the fog away, but it also, I think, makes the image a little bit richer. Dhaysk, in a sense, darkens the image slightly.

00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'm going to add some clarity now to bring out some punch. Clarity is mid-tone contrast.

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I'm going to add a little bit of texture, not too much.

00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I don't really need a lot of this texture. I mean, the only texture I really have is the.

00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Those sort of lines.

00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: On the building. I don't really need to bring any texture out in the in the glass itself.

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: All right, so.

00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That's my before, and that's my after. So.

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Getting a little more graphic, getting a little more abstract. That's what I'm looking for.

00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'm gonna add.

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Little more contrast.

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um, even if even even when you're in a.

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Black and white image. The temperature adjustment does make a difference, because it'll change the.

00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Colors in the image, and the colors affect what the black and white looks like.

00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So, for example, you notice that if I go, if I cool the image down.

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: We are sort of lightening.

00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The blue areas. And if I.

00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Warm it up. The blue areas get darker. So it kind of.

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Does the opposite of what you would expect in a color image.

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And so I always play with this a little bit, just to see.

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: What it does.

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Something like that. Okay? So there's the before.

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And there's my after.

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Now I'm going to come down to the black and white settings.

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And the black and white settings.

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Sometimes we'll.

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Allow me to make a bigger change in an image.

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And basically what you're doing here is you're adjusting.

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The colors of the original image.

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Tonally. So, for example.

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um.

00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Here's red. Red doesn't really do anything.

00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Here's Orange Orange not doing anything.

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Here's green. Green doesn't do much, because again, I don't have any green in the image.

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And that's yellow. I'm sorry. Here's green.

00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Green's not doing much.

00:50:27.000 --> 00:50:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Aqua doesn't do very much.

00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Ah, Blue has a big effect, because blue is in the image, and so by adjusting the blue slider, I'm lightening or darkening.

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The tones where the blue color is.

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And so maybe I'll take these down a little bit like that.

00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Too much. So maybe something around there.

00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Purple doesn't do much, and.

00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Magenta doesn't do much either. So in this case, the only real color that I have in the original image.

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Oops. Sorry that was the wrong button. I meant to press the.

00:51:07.000 --> 00:51:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I meant to press the backslash key. There we go.

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The only color that I really have is blue. So that's the only one that's going to be affected.

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The most, if if at all, with this adjustment here.

00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:23.000
steve guercia: Rob? What does the auto button in that.

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It. Just it just tries to guess what.

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:25.000
steve guercia: Field.

00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Would make the image look the best. So if I click on auto.

00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know, it pushed the blue up to plus 10, and I actually like it a little bit darker, because when I pull the blue down.

00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You notice that I'm getting a little bit better gradation here.

00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So the rest of it doesn't really do anything. Auto is kind of like like auto with the basic panel.

00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But you notice that when I clicked on auto it pushed the blue up.

00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I like the blue a little bit darker, because I'm getting a little bit more gradation in here. So I'm separating the buildings out a bit by making this building.

00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A little darker than the building in front of it.

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If I push the blue up, you notice that.

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Both buildings now look almost.

00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Like they're connected, or you know.

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Almost like they're the same building.

00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I wanted a little bit more space, a little more separation between them.

00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Therefore I'm pulling the blue down. And now you see that.

00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It separates them out a bit. That's too much.

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But something around around there. I think I'm happy with.

00:52:27.000 --> 00:52:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay, I'm going to also come down to effects.

00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I'm just going to apply a pretty good amount of.

00:52:33.000 --> 00:52:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um vignetting.

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Something like that.

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I like that because that sort of.

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Keeps the eye moving from the bottom up into the top of the.

00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Image and the the vignette all around.

00:52:49.000 --> 00:52:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Works for me. Sometimes I will use a local adjustment just to apply it to one or 2 corners, but in this case.

00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um.

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That works fine for me. So now I'm going to come back up to the basic panel and revisit.

00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The black and white, because now I think that, with the addition addition of D of the dehaze, and the addition of the.

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Vignette. I've darkened.

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I brought down my whites a little bit. I want the whites to be a little more, to pop, a little more, to be a little more present.

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So I'm going to push the whites up.

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Something like that.

00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Blacks are okay.

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I'm also going to push up the shadows now.

00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I'm even going to.

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Add some highlights. Okay, so this just goes to show you that it's not always a minus. Again, I want to get a little more sparkle of.

00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Out of the top of the image if I can. So I'm going to push the highlights just a little bit like this.

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Here's the highlights. Notice the top of the buildings at the top where the fog is that really.

00:53:55.000 --> 00:54:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Comes out. So I'm going to just push this up a little bit, maybe plus 10 something like that.

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So again. There's the before you see that in the before.

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know, you're not really.

00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'm not guiding the viewer up the image into the.

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Sky into the fog.

00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It's just sort of uniform throughout in my after.

00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You can see this real dynamic sense of.

00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Pushing the viewer up from the bottom into the center and into the top, but not out of the image.

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That's what the vignette does. It kind of.

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Provides a little dampening of the corner, so that.

00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Really, you know the.

00:54:37.000 --> 00:54:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Movement stays like this.

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And it kind of, you know, circles around comes around.

00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Keeps the viewer inside.

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And that's really what I want.

00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay. So now let's go to sharpening. And this is what I wanted to talk about before.

00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If we come into the detail panel.

00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I don't need Denoise on this. It's pretty clean.

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I don't need super resolution.

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So in sharpening we have 4 adjustments.

00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Amount. That's the amount of sharpening that we're going to add to the image.

00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: We've got radius detail and masking.

00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So let's talk about radius first, st because radius is the one that I think gets. That is the most confusing.

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: What radius does is that it will determine.

00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: How much sharpening away from any edge you're going to have.

00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The higher the radius, the wider the sharpening, the thicker the edge.

00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And the lower the radius, the thinner, the edge.

00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So let me show you a little graphic that I made before.

00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Which is here.

00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So imagine now that we have.

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: One single edge. Okay, to make this simple.

00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Here's a single edge, and here's a single edge.

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But on the left side we're applying a low radius.

00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: With the sharpening adjustment.

00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So, the low radius being, let's say, 0 point 8 pixels. So 0 point 8 pixels, I usually say use 0 point 8 or 0 point 9.

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That's the typical recommended amount.

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: What this means is that from this edge that lightroom detects in your image and an edge.

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Is nothing more than a difference in contrast.

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So think about this now, right? If you don't have a difference in contrast anywhere in your image, you have no edges, so that's like a.

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Clear blue sky.

00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But if you have an an ah.

00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A line, a definitive difference in contrast that creates an edge.

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So here's our hypothetical edge.

00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And if I apply sharpening with a low radius.

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Lightroom is only going to.

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um.

00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Increase the contrast along that edge in a very.

00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Thin or narrow fashion.

00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And that's what you see here, that from the edge out.

00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You only see a change. That's narrow.

00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Now, if you look on the right side, here is using a.

00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Higher radius, 1.8 pixels.

00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And notice that it's the same edge. But lightroom has.

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Enhanced that edge has applied contrast to that edge in a broader way, in a much thicker way.

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And so this edge here appears much thicker.

00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Whereas this edge is much thinner.

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And so you can imagine that if you apply a high radius to an image that has lots of detail in it has lots of edges.

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Most landscapes where you're going to get thick edges, and when you have thick edges on all your edges.

00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That takes away from the very, very, very fine nature of fine detail.

00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So that's why, with landscapes and other images that have a lot of fine detail, you want to use a low radius.

00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So that you're so. That light room.

00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Only adds the sharpening amount.

00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In a very narrow way along each edge, and each edge gets a narrow amount of sharpening, but that preserves all of the.

00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Fine detail of the edges, whereas.

00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: On the right side. Here it applies.

00:57:55.000 --> 00:58:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Applies the sharpening along a wider portion of the edge. Okay.

00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So if we come back to this image.

00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I hope now you can see that.

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I would want to use a.

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Higher radius than a lower radius, because.

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Most of this image is very, very smooth. Notice that there are no edges on the windows, because there is no real change in contrast. The change.

00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Happens when we have the. You know, the structure of the building.

00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So for this I would use a higher radius.

00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Which means that it's going to make each of those edges thicker and more pronounced. But it's going to ignore.

00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Very, very fine edges, which I don't need in this image.

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So that's what the radius does. And we have a range of.

00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Point 5 to.

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um 2.7.

00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So I'm going to be.

00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Point 8 and.

00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Just to check here.

00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yes, this is mistaken. Sorry I'm going to change this now. This should be point.

00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: 8. Thank you for that. There we go.

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So the range is point 5.6 point 7.8.

00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: 1.0 up to 2.5. I believe.

00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Thanks for that. Um!

00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And you see that over here 0 point 8.

00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Then 1, 2.

00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Even up to 3. Okay.

00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So I'm going to leave this around.

00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: 1.8 something like that that's going to give us a wider edge.

00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And not sharpen along very fine edges. The amount is essentially that. How much sharpening we're adding overall.

00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And so usually you always want to do this at a 1 to one ratio. You want to be zoomed in.

00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And that there's no sharpening.

00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That's maximal sharpening. You can see.

00:59:38.000 --> 00:59:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: As I go back and forth.

00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: We're getting more sharpening, especially down here. You can see.

00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The sharpening, and that's less sharpening.

00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And you notice that when I go higher.

00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: We um?

00:59:53.000 --> 00:59:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The sharpening.

00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: We create halos that are obvious, that are, that are almost.

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Detrimental to the image. So that's why you want to be careful that you don't apply too much sharpening to your image because you get these.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Weird halos that's kind of like a light or a white edge around.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Your edges, and that is when you've gone too far with your sharpening.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So I'm going to come down to probably like 40 or 50.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Radius high the detail, Slider. You can think of the detail, Slider, as being connected to the radius slider.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Meaning, that it is a an enhancement.

01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Of your radius setting when it's set low.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If you set a low radius.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A typical landscape point 8.7 point 9.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Then the detail, Slider, when you increase it, will add more texture to the sharpening.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In this case. That's not what I want to do. I don't need more texture. I just need.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Some nice broad edges for the structure of the building, and I leave the fog and the.

01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Glass alone. We don't need to sharpen that. We want that to be smooth.

01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So I'm going to use a low detail setting for this.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: 25 is a default. That's fine.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I only bring again. I only bring this up when I am.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Using a low radius typically most landscapes. I'll show you an example of this next. And then the masking, of course, is one of my favorite adjustments.

01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Which is mask off areas that should not get any sharpening at all.

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And in this case that's going to be a lot of the glass and the fog.

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The way to use this is, you have to press and hold down your option key or alt on a PC.

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then click and drag this masking adjustment to the right.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And you'll see that as I drag it to the right.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Areas that turn black.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Are being protected.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: From the sharpening areas that remain white are still getting the sharpening.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And so I don't want to go too far with this.

01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Well, in this case, I mean, if I took it all the way to the right, this is really just leaving the sharpening on the structure of the building.

01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Maybe this is okay. But maybe something like that.

01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And this just this just allows you to make the sharpening.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: More natural, more organic.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: More. Um, yeah, more more natural. So that we're not sharpening things that don't need to be sharpened like the fog, and like the surface of the glass, etcetera.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay, so that's that's the sharpening adjustment. There.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In a nutshell. I'll show you another example with a landscape.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But that's basically what I would do to this image. The last thing I would do to this image, by the way, is.

01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Just a little bit of.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Darkening. I want to get a little more.

01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Little more um.

01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Presence out of the side of the building. Here.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So I'm going to use a darkening.

01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A mask, maybe set this to minus 20.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Something like that, just something very subtle.

01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And.

01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Maybe something like that.

01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Alright, and that's that mass there, just to get a little more.

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Definition. Here.

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Because that really is the.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This area here is where I'm transitioning from the lights to the mids and then down into the darks.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I want that transition to be as smooth as possible.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So I want to make this a little bit darker, so that.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It really leads us down into the very darkest darks down here without any.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Abrupt jumps, and that just makes.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The image feels smoother, more abstract.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um, and just more.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Gentle for the eyes, if you will.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay, so that's.

01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The before and after, and those of you who were with me on Monday for the print lab. I made a print of this on on rag Photographique, and it looked.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I was happy with the way it came out. I used the matte paper for this, and I thought it looked really good in that paper.

01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Let me just show you one more image, different one. Now.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Let's say I'm going to do the sharpening again on this. Okay.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'm going to go into the detail panel.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And this one is the complete opposite of the last image.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:04:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Here. I do have lots of detail. Have lots of edges. If you zoom in here.

01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Right. There's just edges everywhere all over this rock.

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Over here, etc.

01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So I'm going to.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Use a low radius.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Maybe even lower than this 0 point 8.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And what that means is, again, when I use a low radius, I'm applying.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The sharpening in a very thin way.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To each edge. That means that.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In this graphic. You're only seeing one edge. But imagine the image has.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know many, many thousands of these edges, or whatever it is, each edge gets a thin.

01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Amount of sharpening, but that makes each edge.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: More pronounced, giving you the impression, or giving you the look.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Of of great.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Fine detail.

01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Now I'll increase the amount.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Something like that.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And here I can use the detail.

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Slider, to increase micro detail.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay? And then again, the masking.

01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The masking here does a wonderful job, because I don't want any of this sharpening in the sky.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I want it on the rock formations.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So I'm going to press and hold the option key.

01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And notice that immediately, like lightroom, creates a mask for me, and it knows where the edges are.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And it knows where there, where there aren't edges.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And so this really, just.

01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Creates an image.

01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And subsequently a print that has a lot more depth because.

01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Again, you know, sharpening.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Or detail. Our eyes are attracted to detail.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And it. It gives us the impression of the illusion of being closer, and things that are less sharp are further away.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: More in the distance. And so with something like this, the sky and these areas in the back.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Would receive more.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And the areas that are sharper would come forward.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: By the way, I will show you this on.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Over Zoom. But you have to try this on your own computer, because I'm not sure how much of this will come over.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In the stream.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But all of these adjustments here.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The radius, and the detail can be visualized by holding down the option key.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So, for example, if I hold down the option key.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then adjust the radius.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You get this gray overlay.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And you can actually see the.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Thickness of the edges. So notice, as I increase the radius.

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Well, I'm sure you can see something there.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You see how much thicker each of the edges gets.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But the problem with them getting thicker is that they're going to overlap, and that essentially will take away the fine detail because you're making each edge.

01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The sharpening amount on each edge thicker.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I want that to be as thin as possible.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Because making it thinner.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Preserves the nature of the photo.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And same thing with the detail, Slider. If I hold down option or alt on the PC.

01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If I bring detail down.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Well, you don't really see much happening if I push the detail up.

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You can see. I can see.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Some ah!

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Micro detail coming through, you may not be able to see it, but if you try it on your computer.

01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Especially if you have a 4 k. Monitor, you'll definitely be able to see that.

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: All right. So each of these adjustments you can hold on the option or alt key.

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To see the effect.

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To get this gray overlay. That shows you.

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: What the actual sharpening is doing from a tonal perspective. Because that's really all sharpening is it's increasing contrast.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Along edges.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Alrighty um.

01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So Jeff asks, after using Denoise, which softens an image, do you ever often, and then add the sharpening to bring back the look of more detail.

01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So that's a good question, Jeff. And actually.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The brilliant thing about the.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Denoise Feature.

01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In fact.

01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So let's zoom in here.

01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Let's go to 200%. Okay?

01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And you can see the sharpening there.

01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I'm going to turn on Denoise.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So.

01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If any of you noticed.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It actually looks a little bit sharper. Now.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: With the Denoise. Can anybody tell me why? It looks a little bit sharper.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: With the Denoise applied.

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Anyone.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Well remember. The Denoise also has another feature called raw details.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And that's what that's for. So the raw details is.

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And is applied together with the Denoise.

01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And that actually will.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Improve the.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Rendering of the raw file. So whatever you lose with the Denoise you gain back, it's sometimes a little more.

01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: With the raw details. So to your question, Jeff.

01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I usually think of the general sharpening, independent of the Denoise. In other words.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I sharpen the image to make it look as good as I can. As good as I want it to look in terms of sharpness.

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then, if I have noise, I apply the Denoise, and I don't think.

01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'm not thinking in terms of oh, the Denoise is going to. It's going to impact the sharpening. So now I have to go back.

01:09:41.000 --> 01:09:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And readjust the sharpening. I think of them really independently.

01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And that's really the advantage that.

01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That this new feature is adding.

01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um, and as far as doing one before the other. No, that's the other advantage to.

01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Developing in the raw. And again, this is not only lightroom, but raw developing is.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Non-destructive. So you can do these adjustments in any order that you like. You can start with Denoise and jump to basic and.

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Whatever you want, when you render up, when you, when when lightroom renders the image on screen, or sends it to print or exports it for for Jpeg, or whatever.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It will apply all of the.

01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Rendering in the order that optimizes the quality of the image so.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It doesn't really matter how or what order you do it in.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: All right, folks. Any any other questions on.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The sharpening or lightroom in general, or any of the updates that we talked about any.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Anything else.

01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:52.000
mzely: Oh, that image with the skyscrapers.

01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah.

01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:58.000
mzely: Uh. Can you show the side by side.

01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000
mzely: The original and the processed.

01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Sure! Oops! Sorry!

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000
mzely: Oh, you see uh.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:15.000
mzely: The original has more flavor or more feeling of the.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:17.000
mzely: Fog.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um.

01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay.

01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:31.000
mzely: So, yeah, that's my, that's always my problem with processing the images within a foggy situation.

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I mean um.

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I mean. I hear what you're saying. I understand what you mean like in terms of the original.

01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You feel. The effect of fog, perhaps, is what you're saying, or it's more about fog. But.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: For me. The fog is just.

01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I don't. I'm.

01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To be honest, I'm not thinking of that word fog.

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay. So I'm not saying, what's the fog doing? What's the building doing? I'm looking at it as.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A um.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: As different tones and different amounts of.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Softness and hardness, and where I want those where I want that transition to be.

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So I think I mentioned.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I think I mentioned at the beginning that one of the reasons I converted to black and white is to get is to make the image more abstract, more graphic.

01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And once I do that, I'm really not thinking about buildings anymore. I'm thinking about these shapes that change and morph and.

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know, sort of disappear into this lighter tone.

01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'm not thinking fog anymore.

01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Because fog is something very literal. I want something more like.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: More abstract, more dreamy. If you will.

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: As long as you can see that this building disappears.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That's what I want.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.000
mzely: Okay. Thank you.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I mean, and that's I mean, that's that's part of.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know. That's a that's a good observation. There.

01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It's part of just how you're going to, how you think about.

01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um photography in general, how you think about your image.

01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: What you're trying to convey to the viewer. If you want to say.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: What do you want to say? Do you want to say this is fog, or do you want to say.

01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know. Um, this is.

01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Light and movement and.

01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And a visually interesting thing to look at. Right. Those are 2 different things.

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah.

01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The original is cool water vapor. Exactly. Yeah. Again.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um. When I looked up at the sky I wasn't thinking about any of those things. I was just thinking I'm attracted to.

01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'm attracted to just.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Mood and variation and dynamics.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In a sense you could think of it like music, you know, if you listen to good music. I'm not thinking about the instruments anymore. I'm not thinking about.

01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um the orchestration. I'm just moved.

01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And taken away by just the sounds.

01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:04.000
