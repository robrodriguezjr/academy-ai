00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: All right! Welcome, everyone! Welcome to another Creative path, academy, live session. Says, number 21, Pretty sure of that. Welcome everyone. It's great to have a good group tonight. Fantastic. Um David and Mildred Michelle.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: David Rosenfeld. Welcome, Donald! Welcome Harry, Ellen. Welcome. Hello! Welcome, Jerry! Welcome, Karen Comstock and Karen Kerwick Great to always have you guys here Welcome, Mark, Steve Tom and and the other Steve, Steve Harrell So welcome, everyone. It's great Once again. Thank you for joining me tonight.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And so today we are continuing on our series that I'm calling, mastering composition We've been Working on this series. Now for Several months I've been Focusing on different Aspects of composition going deeper into each of the broad categories Things like lines and shapes and patterns. Today patterns and rhythm We talked about the frame many months ago, and

00:04:44.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: These honestly are topics that I can talk about forever. And we can always discuss them, because there's always something more to learn, even when I am preparing to Talk about these topics. I learn a lot because I want to explain them as best I can, and of course I learn as well And Composition is one of those things where it's never ending. When you think you've Reached a certain level. Then, of course, you realize there are other levels and other Ways, to

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To create and to compose and to be creative, similar to music. Music will be a theme that I'll be bringing up a lot today Um. Part of that is because of my musical background. As a. You know, musician really was. How I got started in my creative life, so to speak. And it's always Uh I was going to say in the back of my mind, but it's More often in the front of my mind And there are many similarities, many parallels between music and photography.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I, you know I try not to geek out on those things too much when I'm talking to others who maybe don't relate as well as As I do, but of course I think it's a really valuable thing to Try to Understand and think about, because music is again one of these universal languages. Similar to visual language that we all intuitively understand. We've been around music our whole lives It's been a Part, some part of our lives, for for everyone. And If you start to appreciate these parallels, I think they really do give you a lot more depth into what's going on compositionally, tonally.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Rhythmically right, and all of those words I heard when I was studying music so There's a lot of great parallels there Anybody else joined. I do not see anyone So again I'll be sharing. I'll be sharing a lot Today If you have any feedback or questions, or anything you want me to clarify, just please post it in the comments, or you can unmute your microphone and just Just let me know! Shout out. And I will stop and try to elaborate, or if there's anything that you feel you want to add to the conversation By all means feel free.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: One thing I will also mention. I don't know if I maybe I've alluded to this in the past. But in all of the presentations that I do, and everything that I share, everything I'm drawing images from 2 sources Either images that are not mine, in which case they will always be captioned And lots of times if I'm doing it in a private session like this, then I give Oh! Credit to the photographers, and I don't share it publicly. I'm not sharing it in any sense, except for us here, and there's a Fair Use Act that I can do that under

00:07:32.000 --> 00:08:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: When I do it publicly. Like on Youtube or anything out in the real world. I don't share anyone's images unless I explicitly have permission So I'm either sharing someone else's work in which you will see captioned And if you don't see a caption Then it's mine. It's my photograph. And so I just want to clarify that As a photographer. I'm very sensitive to that as well. So And luckily a lot of the paintings that I share. I'll be showing some paintings today Are older paintings which are common usage. So that's that's kind of useful as well Okay. So with that, said, Um.

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Let's get started So, as I said today, I'm going to talk about pattern and rhythm And how useful, how important that is! How powerful that can be as a visual tool in photography Now? What is Pattern and rhythm. Well, let's start with some basic definitions So pattern is A repeated visual element, something that repeats over and over and over again, that creates some structure Some. Unity. Some movement patterns tend to do these kinds of things. They create

00:08:47.000 --> 00:09:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A sense of structure. And depending on the pattern, they may create some movement And Rhythm as I'm using it. Here is the You can think of it as the visual tempo Or the flow that's created When you vary the pattern. So a static pattern, one that doesn't change is static. And so It's not going to have a lot of variation. But when you introduce variation, and there are many ways to do this Then you get some tempo, some rhythm, because

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Now you're not looking at the pattern innate Sort of very static way, but in a dynamic way you can speed up or slow down, or You can do this to the viewer. So when the viewer is looking at your image, you can use this to Control the way they look at the image So here's a very straightforward example by this image is by Michael Freeman. And this is a Fairly static image in terms of the pattern, right and You can see that the pattern goes completely across the frame All the way

00:09:47.000 --> 00:10:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And It creates a sense of unity. In a sense it simplifies the image a bit But the rhythm or the tempo here is very static and very steady. You're looking at the whole thing You know, left to right, up and down. Maybe there's a little bit of slowing down here But for the most part it's very, very static. Now, here's A painting by Maynard Dixon. This is a little bit different now. Right now we've got pattern But the pattern has a visual tempo to it, because there's much more variation And so

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Once he establishes this shape down here. You see these patterns So this is a pattern of repeating Triangular shapes, but you notice that now they start to vary in their shape, in their size. And they get More numerous back here Right. etc, etc. And so this Difference creates a tempo. You. Your eye moves through the foreground much slower Than it does in the background. In the background you tend to sort of unify everything together in the foreground

00:10:51.000 --> 00:11:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: There's more spacing, and that's what I mean by This sense of tempo Now, another way to think about it is that The pattern is the thing that's repeating in the image, and the and the rhythm or the tempo. It's how it's repeating Whether it's repeating. Abruptly or smoothly, or gradually, or etc. And Patterns create, or they can create momentum, a sense of continuation Beyond the frame. And this is very important, because

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: When you have a pattern that extends edge to edge in your frame. This will suggest to the viewer that that pattern extends beyond the frame, and that creates a sense of momentum and I mean, this has to do with psychological Ideas from Gestalt. I'll be talking about Gestalt theory in the future. But is a sense of continuation, and this can be used In a way to Um Create a sense of movement. Patterns also create simplicity. So we're always trying to simplify our images. We're always trying to find ways to

00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Unify. The image pattern is one of those ways So here's an edge to edge pattern Right, meaning that the pattern extends to the edge of the frame And that already implies that this is not just in this area. In other words, this pattern is not just in my frame. But it extends beyond it, and I'm just capturing a small part of it. And you can see here also that A pattern slowly changes, so that as we move into the distance There's a There's a change in tempo. There's a change in rhythm

00:12:28.000 --> 00:13:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Now Again. I'm going to bring up this idea of of visual music. It's Kind of what I'm thinking about. It Because it allows me to explain it. I can. I can see it and hear it. And I want you guys to at least understand this as well, so As I mentioned Rhythm. Can be. Smooth or punctuated, you can have a rhythm that is Gradual, and one that isn't contrast has a lot to do with this. So if you have a high contrast image that will punctuate rhythms that you have in your in your

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Punctuate the areas in your image. And the reason why this is important is because These things, let you control the viewer's path through the image And That's how we get a narrative. That's how we get a. That's how we get a story. We get a story by making something in the image. More important More uh A focal point. If you will Right. So there's this idea of slow and fast movement through an image You can use contrast to vary the tempo. And of course I'll show you examples of all of these things. And the rhythm can be smooth or

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Gradual. Okay. Um. Smooth. And gradual or punctuated, meaning that you have abrupt changes So here's a fairly regular pattern, all right. You can have Regular patterns, like the 1st one with the birds or irregular patterns. Here's a fairly regular pattern And You can see that it Generally repeats

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In a regular way. There's a slight change here, right? The shapes are getting closer and closer and closer, and that tends to create this Sense of movement into the image, but it's fairly regular I tend to prefer me. Personally, I tend to prefer more irregular patterns, because They create it a little bit more dynamic in the image But of course this is The way I'm using it, and you're open to use it any way you want. But Trying to explain what How this affects the viewer. Here's another semi-regular pattern Meaning, that

00:14:31.000 --> 00:15:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: We see what the pattern is, and we see it changing. And we can actually notice that it's changing ever so slightly. And so it's irregular in that. It's predictable But we can see that slight change. And again this creates a sense of movement. So right here you can see how your eye Is slower at the bottom, and then it starts to accelerate and speed up as you get towards the top of the image And that's this idea of Temple that I'm talking about. Now, here's a an image by Michael Kenna, and you can see here a very sort of Static pattern right? And he's taking this pattern from one Edge to the other. And so again, this idea that The.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Thing, the pattern in the object The pattern in the frame extends beyond the composition And it feels very structured. So From a tempo standpoint, from a rhythmic standpoint very structured. Here you can see how You get this sense of very structured movement Structured movement this way as well And then, you know, there's some little accents here But for the most part very sort of structured Nope.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:16:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Here's a more irregular pattern, right? One that Has more. Change in terms of the Um Edges, and the shapes, and the How the pattern repeats. So these little intervals here You see that they're much more Unpredictable. Much more random, if you will

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay. And that creates much more sense of a A pattern that has more variation to it This is also a pattern where the change is rather on the gradual side, not completely gradual. But it's Kind of gradual right? You're not. You're not really stopping in this area or stopping in this area. You're kind of Moving. Throughout the image Here's an example where you have a much more punctuated Pattern. Right.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:17:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Because You kind of move very quickly through here, and then this is a stop, not a full stop, of course. But it's a much harder stop you slow down here. Right, because you've got much greater change in contrast, much greater change in the Tempo, and then And then it picks up again over here So it's about how the viewer Looks at an image, how their eye scans through an image, and where they slow down, where they speed up And that.

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Can influence, or you can have an influence on where or what you're going to make more important in the image And so for me. These 3 columns here Kind of establish or introduce the image. But then, as we get over here. Then we've got More interest, because now we've got columns that are behind and in front, it's more dynamic, more abstract. If you will So that's a much more. Punctuated pattern But here's

00:17:30.000 --> 00:18:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A painting by William Trust Richards. This is A pattern within a pattern. Now, taking it to much more something that's much more natural, not as abstract But you got this 2 patterns. One is a very smooth and gradual pattern of the Leaves in the background, right? These subtle colors. And they're just repeating throughout oranges and the yellows, oranges and yellows, oranges and yellows Down here as well And that is punctuated By the pattern of these trees And again.

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: With Fair amount of variation. All right. You can see those trees there. And Not only Are the trees in certain groupings that Changes the way you look at the image right? You're going to slow down more in this area, and then you're going to speed up more over here, then perhaps slow down and then speed up again. When you see patterns that are more consistent And more predictable, and patterns that are slightly less predictable. That's going to slow you down. And that's where he's placed his focal point. His focal point is right here

00:18:34.000 --> 00:19:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Because that's where the pattern is Very punctuated. So this is a really nice design in terms of patterns within patterns Here's Another painting by the same painter, William Truss, Richards. Again using the same visual Ideas of composition that are open and available to any visual artist. Right Here is a very, very smooth. Punctuated, or, I should say, punctuated rhythm. Here

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then things smooth out over here because the contrast is lower, and because the contrast is lower, these patterns Your eye can move through them quickly. He's repeating this pattern in the sky with the clouds And then you've got a very punctuated pattern here with these rocks. So it's rocks all the way through. But the variation and the spacing of the rocks This is another beautiful area where he leaves the spacing And that spacing creates A slowdown for your eye, and then you jump To the other area, and the other area, again, is an area that has high contrast because of the light Eye. Contrast here because of the shadow

00:19:42.000 --> 00:20:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And so you've got nice opposites there. You've also got this pattern of the waves So this whole image is made of repeating patterns in a way that allows you to take in the image And your eyes Generally moving In that. Sort of flow in that direction. Here's another painting by Ivan Shishkin, a Fantastic Russian painter that really was a master at painting trees

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And Here you've got again patterns within patterns. So we've got A couple of trees here in the foreground, these down trees, you can barely see them, but there's some trees that create That really nice. Pattern with Varying spaces, here And then We've got much stronger patterns These punctuated patterns

00:20:37.000 --> 00:21:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Meaning that the contrast level is much higher, and so that makes them stand out more But even so, he blends the contrast areas here, and he blends the contrast areas here and here So that They come become sort of like groupings of patterns. So you've got One big pattern here. Another one over here. And another one over here But at the end of the day there are all patterns within patterns In a way that sort of highlights

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The top of the frame, and the bottom of the frame is just your introduction, and then we've got a lot of activity up here Here's another pattern Consisting of Varying shapes Right, so shapes on top of other shapes, and There's a new idea that I want to introduce here, which is this idea of disrupting a pattern So if I had rocks going all the way to the top of the frame Something like that Maybe here.

00:21:40.000 --> 00:22:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Then this pattern would extend through the frame But the pattern is disrupted by The water by these smooth areas And so what this does is that it allows you to follow this pattern Up to here And then when you get to that space, then it slows you down and it invites you to come back And explore the pattern again. So it creates this sense of repetition Starting from here. Up to here

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So that's a way of controlling the viewer's eye. And I'm essentially trying to do that in this direction. Along this diagonal Now, here's a photograph by British photographer, Charlie Waite Here's another concept in patterns, which is Placing a pattern inside of some negative shape Or negative space. I'm sorry inside of negative space. So Here's the pattern that he establishes these beautiful trees And you can see the spacing here is always varying

00:22:47.000 --> 00:23:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So that creates a sense of asymmetry or a sense of randomness. There's also another pattern here in the foreground But the grasses A lot of texture as well. But there, you can see that pattern But he is adding a lot of Space. Here. And that space encloses the pattern inside of the frame So you're not going edge to edge like some of the other images that we're looking at. You're basically

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Moving inside and staying in the frame. So it's more of a Isolated pattern within the frame, and that again Controls the viewer's attention. The viewer's eyepath in the image. You're not going to go up here You're not going to go up here You're not going to leave the frame You're really going to go to the focal point, the center of interest, which is itself A pattern And a rhythmic one, because We get larger and larger and larger, and then the tempo slows down right? So that's how you can see the sense of rhythm

00:23:47.000 --> 00:24:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Slowing down as we get To the Big Tree Or the bigger shape Here's an image by Joe Cornish. Another British photographer and Same thing as the last image in terms of Enclosing the pattern inside the frame. You don't really feel the pattern moving edge to edge And a part of that is because

00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: These trees here move down in the frame And by down. What I really mean is, they move forward right? They move towards us. So there's a sense of depth Some of the other images where the trees were left to right. They felt like they were on their own plane, but here The trees are moving forward. And so we have this sense of Depth to the image So we don't feel like this pattern is moving left or moving us to the left and to the right, but moving us Into the frame Right. That's how this pattern feels like it's moving us Into the frame

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And That creates a sense of Depth to the image. We also see some of these trees Back in the distance So I really like this image in terms of The simplicity of it, but at the same time The patterns here Are. Very.

00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Important. As I said. Left and right, but also These. Intervals. You can imagine if we had this image. Imagine if in this image all the trees were coming down in the same place. It would be Much less interesting. It would feel like trees that were just lined up, whereas now they have again this sense of depth to them And yes, Ivan Shishkin

00:25:50.000 --> 00:26:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Was an amazing painter, particularly his As I said, trees were really something he did really? Well, so yeah, thanks for that, mark Here's another pattern This is a pattern of Or I would say, this is patterns within patterns. There's 2 things going on here. 2 things that I kind of saw. One was the flowers themselves. And the other one was That leaves. Surrounding the flowers, because the leaves also have their Very unique shapes and very distinct shapes

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And you can see that very clearly. So the challenge for me was How to make sure you know how to capture These leaves in a way that you could appreciate those shapes The pattern, but at the same time not lose the most obvious pattern, which is The flowers themselves Because of the distinct color And, by the way, here's an image where I experimented with Converting to black and white. Don't know why. I just something that I do. When I'm thinking about patterns, you can see patterns of Black and white is very conducive to patterns, but

00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The. Color. Allows the 2 patterns to coexist. If you will Convert it to black and white, you lose that separation between the 2 things. So here's an example where the color really is critical and the black and white Would not work. But here's a pattern where You can see that I'm taking a lot of these flowers right to the edge of the frame sometimes to create a bit of tension But also because I think there's a sense that this extends beyond the frame, and so I'm not cutting off something that you only have

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That to see there's much more of it outside the frame And so you can take much more liberties with where you Sort of truncate things Again, if you establish a pattern and Important thing is here is that I'm taking it right to the edge everywhere. So here, here Here. Here. Um And that pretty much tells you that

00:27:52.000 --> 00:28:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This is Extending beyond. Or at least implies it. Here's an image by Huntington Witherill. This is A photographer that we've looked at in the past Really beautiful. Black and white image But The subtle use of pattern here is

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Really nice. With these rocks Different shapes, different sizes. Right. You see them there. And this is what creates this sense of movement Variation. It invites us to look at the image. It makes the image interesting, because there is this Pattern that is unpredictable, that is That is repeating, but repeating in a way that is Enjoyable to look at And then, of course, he brings you to the foreground.

00:28:50.000 --> 00:29:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And to the distance. With this Beautiful foreground here and Sort of a few Pointers, if you will. I wouldn't call this a pattern in the foreground But it's certainly a way to anchor the image So that the pattern kind of sits on top Of This foreground. So in a way, that's another way of punctuating a pattern right

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: We. Kind of move through here, and then we kind of come down here and slow down for a while. Take this all in and kind of establishes the image, and then we're back up here again, bouncing around Again. That's a way of changing the tempo And also look at the amount of negative space that he leaves in the sky. Right. A lot of space here And that is to really anchor and emphasize the image Down here. The sky, however, provides this very Subtle and

00:29:42.000 --> 00:30:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Relaxing feel to the image every Quite. Aspect to the image. Notice, there are very little clouds. There's a lot of. There's not a lot of texture. There's not Tremendous drama. It just invites a sort of It adds a lot of spaciousness to the image the image has it breathes. If you will This area here because he's giving it all this room on top Also the so-called Horizon.

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: At the mid level right? There's another rule broken And doesn't Hamper the image at all. Here's a an image by Another great. Black and white photographer, American photographer, John Sexton And once again using Various patterns. Here a multitude of patterns. Yes, the image is composed of shapes

00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But it's the shapes arranged in a particular order That your eye. Bounces. And moves from one to the other And then, of course. Another. Pattern here. With Variation in the spacing between the trees

00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The angles. And also notice we were talking before about Regular patterns versus irregular patterns. He varies, that in this image This pattern here much more regular, much more Much more predictable. When we get over here Much less predictable. You have to keep looking and looking to see how the pattern changes And so that creates

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A nice Sense of movement, left and right. But really he's anchoring you top to bottom because he's moving things forward in the Field of view, if you will right. So the image gains a lot of depth Particularly with these Branches, or these trees Reflecting in the foreground And so again, that is what creates A sense of depth. And the image moving backwards and forwards.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: There was a previous example where I talked about the trees

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:51.000
David Luery: Woo-hoo

00:31:51.000 --> 00:32:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Being grounded on the moving forward Here he's placing the trees All in the same plane, or at least he's using the edge of this lake or river to place them on the same plane. So You've got this sense of 2 levels to the image. This moves you in And then. Now this is The top part is sort of flat, so There's not a foreground, middle ground and background, just a foreground, and then a middle ground Here's another image where

00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'm using the patterns in the foreground Really as a way to punctuate the image Because Everything else in the back is pretty much Very airy, very spacious. A lot of fog And yet these Shapes in the foreground appeared, so to speak, as the fog was Moving. Moving away, or dissipating

00:32:50.000 --> 00:33:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And Because of the reflections in the sky, it almost makes them Makes these uh These pylons. That's what they are. Pylons in the river feel like they're floating Kind of floating in space. There And Once again! A very. Sort of

00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Repetitive tempo here And then it slows down a bit. Here. Because the spacing of the Shapes. Good. More. Irregular, if you will Right. And so that's again. This is how you can Control how the viewer looks at an image where you want them to look, where you want them to go

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The kind of movement that you create. I don't want the viewer to Go over here. I want them to go This way. And that's done through The most. Random aspect of the pattern being in this spot. Here Not to mention that it's also the brightest spot. Notice that it's dark over here moving this way so

00:33:52.000 --> 00:34:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Patterns, together with Tonality and Dark to light, kind of movement. Again helps you to Keep the viewer Engaged in your focal point. Now, another thing you can do with patterns, and you've seen this in a few images already is to use perspective So in some of the other images, where We're capturing.

00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The photographer, the artist. Or myself. Whatever is Capturing. The trees. Or the shapes, or the elements? Or what have you in a very Parallel fashion to the camera Here I'm using perspective, so that as things move away into the distance They also change. Their pattern. So notice that the pattern here

00:34:45.000 --> 00:35:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Is moving left and right. But as we move into the distance, both In terms of the distance to the camera, but also in terms of the pattern itself. It gets Smaller and Tighter and faster. So here the tempo Is. Faster at the top, and then it slows down as we move to the bottom And then it's got a little bit of speeding up here

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: As you move elements together. You can speed up the tempo as you move them apart, and punctuate them with contrast or light. Or color. You can slow down And so notice that the strongest color, the strongest light, the strongest contrast, is in that area. And that's kind of the Part of the image that I want you to slow down a little bit I don't want you to just zoom through the image I want to slow down the viewer a little bit And then speed them up again

00:35:46.000 --> 00:36:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Here's another example. Again. Using perspective So I'm getting the camera kind of low to the ground. To emphasize the foreground And the shapes in the foreground. Of course. All of these bushes are the same size But through. Perspective, and through the use of the lens I can make the pattern change

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In terms of size. So this bush here is exactly the same size as this one here But because I'm using a wider angle lens I, Emphasize or exaggerate. The size of the foreground and diminish the size of the background. What does that do? That creates a natural pattern of Diminishing size. So bigger, smaller.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:37:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Smaller, smaller, smaller, smaller, smaller, smaller. As we get to the back Also, the pattern here is really helped by the fact that the bushes are very distinct to the ground in terms of color. Green and red are roughly opposites on the color wheel, and so that makes one stand out from the other. Makes it very easy to establish this pattern If this was on a green Ground, or if the ground was some kind of a greenish tint, much more difficult, not as interesting Ah! Not as punctuated, if you will The other thing that's important here is that

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Because I am diminishing the Size of these bushes into the background, they get less important I also want to make sure that nothing back here So, for example, this Rock here, or these greens back here Call too much attention to themselves, because That's what I want. This part of the image to do And so I've toned this down a bit

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I've just. I've just Desaturated the color. A tiny bit So that that remains in the background Because I have a hierarchy in the image, and I want to develop that hierarchy Right here. Right here, and then slowly. Diminish in the back. So then we can get this movement up and down, the more you can keep a viewer moving through your image In any direction But of course there are directions that are easier than others

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Diagonals. The more you can keep them moving, the more the image is interesting, the more they want to return to it, the more they want to keep scanning through the image. If they look At one thing and everything else is uninteresting, and that one thing isn't powerful enough to keep them in the frame, you know, like A powerful portrait Then you're going to. You're going to lose Their attention, and that won't make, for as Powerful in image, and it'll be much harder to Create a narrative or story in the image Here's

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Another example. A combination of Tonality. Color. And These. Repeating ridges in this Rock, face. So there's

00:38:52.000 --> 00:39:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: These patterns. And you see how they change, and they get more, faster And then I'm also helped by the changes in color, right? So the changes in color as well create These. Interesting vertical patterns. So patterns within patterns and Notice that I have tried to Keep. Movement like this

00:39:21.000 --> 00:40:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The way you achieve that is, by making the change the most obvious change moving into the corners, if possible. So your eye starts here and notice that the change is happening this way, and I'm continually pushing, or at least the way I framed it. Right. That was the idea behind the framing to continually push the viewer Into that edge. And so now You've got this dynamic sort of movement anytime. You have diagonals Implied. Or suggested. You're going to have much more of a dynamic feel to your image than one where you've got Horizontal lines, which are very static Here's what an image! By Jay Mizell, great New York photographer

00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This is a beautiful example of A, Static pattern in the background, punctuated by very specific And beautifully placed object. Right? So you've got this Sort of subtle pattern in the background, very Static. And then He stops you immediately. With that

00:40:33.000 --> 00:41:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Take the bird out and Pretty much. It's a it's a Mundane kind of Boring image. But this pattern here that keeps you moving left and right all of a sudden stops you, and you have to, no matter how time you go through the image You keep coming back. And so that's an example of Of a disruption to the pattern And this is another powerful technique you can use when you've Got a pattern that you're establishing, and you want to sort of anchor the eye on something or

00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: There's something that pops into the image in this case. Probably this bird landed on the water, and he said, Okay, that's What I needed to now make this much more interesting Add some depth to the image Okay, so. This is A pretty rare thing what I'm going to show you now, which is a bunch of images leading up to A final image. A lot of you have asked me for this Examples like this, where I can show you like, okay, here's my final image. And then here are 10 images that led to it. And I have a hard time finding those, because

00:41:39.000 --> 00:42:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um I'm not necessarily like photographing the same thing over and over and over again. I tend to bounce around and try different ideas, and I sometimes don't keep those images But I actually happened to find a bunch of images that in a way show you my thought process. So here is a lake that I showed up at in Acadia National Park many years ago. One morning I didn't know what I was going to photograph. It was my 1st time there This was the scene And I made an image here. Nothing special. Wasn't Really excited about it. That was kind of how I established

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The kind of grounded myself, but I did immediately recognize that there were lots of these little grasses growing in the water Water was extremely calm. You had rocks, etc. So I thought, okay. I don't feel like making a landscape here. There's nothing here that I'm interested in. What I am fascinated by is the details So I started to explore and play with some of these details. So that's One of the 1st ideas I went from the entire scene To. Drastically simplifying it on the other end, like, let's see how simple I can possibly make this

00:42:53.000 --> 00:43:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It's okay. That was My initial idea. None of these images are images that I kept. I'll show you the one at the end where I feel like I was something that I that I do keep So because that was sort of very simple, I thought, Okay, well, let me now try. Let me now start, including things There's this idea that I've talked about in composition a lot, and I'm sure you've heard it from others, which is Remove As much as possible And Remove, remove as much as you can from the composition while still Maintaining the core essence, or story of the image

00:43:27.000 --> 00:44:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And in this case I lost the story of the image right? I went too far I want to include a little bit more. I want to have a little more context. I'm noticing gradations in the water colors, etc. So now I back away, or I zoom out a little bit, or I change my perspective. And now I mean I'm including more I like This, and I like this along the top edge But still feels a little busy to me still I don't feel like I'm moving. The viewer The way I would like them to. It's too easy to bounce around to here, or to here or up here.

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So I need to establish a pattern That has a little more of a tempo to it that has 8, Starting point and ending point, so to speak. There's a big space here. So I try to fill that space By moving. My camera to the left. And now I'm creating more of this edge to edge pattern that I talked about at the beginning. Where now you create More movement. Notice that here

00:44:30.000 --> 00:45:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You kind of float here And you kind of float here Here you can start to feel more of this direction of movement through the frame, left and right. Because I'm Using the entire frame edge to edge It's still a little ambiguous, if you will But not Quite what I'm looking for So. One thing that I will sometimes try is notice that all the previous images where this was a vertical. Then I went to horizontal. Now I went back to vertical again, because now I'm starting to see another pattern

00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Emerging. And this pattern is The clouds in the sky. That are leaving some reflections in the water And so now I'm trying to combine those 2 things together. I really like This pattern of the white and blue Against. The greens. But of course here I got excited about the sky. So I'm you know this whole bottom part of the image is the sky But it's an idea. It's now an idea that I have a seed in my head about what I'm looking for. And now I can start to

00:45:35.000 --> 00:46:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Improve iterate if you will. So that I can make that idea stronger Here. Notice I'm removing some of the top And Simplifying a bit Notice also that I'm keeping this Movement, left and right. So I'm Trying to keep these waves or waves, these

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Clouds. Moving like that Not like this And That's my final image. So what changed from here to here. Well, what changed is that? Here. I don't really have Anything going on down here

00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It's a bit Empty if you will, no activity going on And also I don't like the way this Kind of ends up here Here. This establishes The movement into the frame And then I'm anchoring the image here

00:46:47.000 --> 00:47:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'm also using a Relatively shallow, shallow depth of field To push this into the distance In some of the previous images. I was using a greater depth of field. And these these areas back here were sharp With these, as well You can change the hierarchy of the Elements in your picture and change the pattern itself Again through perspective, as I've talked about before, and also through using a Shallow depth of field. So now this is

00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Obviously the part of the image that I want you to sort of focus on or land on, as you've explored But This creates. A little. Movement and Sort of a dynamic entrance to the image And then, because this is horizontal, it sort of slows you down Okay, so that's An example of

00:47:42.000 --> 00:48:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The kind of Iteration that I would do or typically do when I'm in the field I don't stay on one image Generally speaking, I, and keep photographing it unless the light is changing, or something like that. I tend to try different ideas Move things around the frame, move them. Higher up. Move them lower down. I play with these edges Because the edges themselves

00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Create shapes in the composition as we've talked about in the past, the edges of the frame will Change. The pattern will Create emphasis on the pattern, or take away emphasis on the pattern And so I keep exploring, keep playing and I didn't know anything. I mean, I wasn't sure whether this was the image that I would like when I got back home. It was just a question of. Here's another idea, and let me keep trying other ones. I'm not thinking too much about. This is the one I'm thinking about. How many different ideas can I come up with How many different ways can I find to photograph what's happening in front of me? Later on I'll decide.

00:48:42.000 --> 00:49:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: What I like, or what's What's working and what not, and what what's not working And the reason for that is probably because If you spend time Being an editor in the field, then you don't have time to be a To be creative. Right? That's a 2 part different size of your brain. Editing images, seeing what works, seeing what doesn't work, and Coming up with ideas are 2 different things. And so I try not to

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Judge my images in the field. Judging is later in front of the computer When I'm in the field there's too many things going on, whether it's the light or the shadow Stars moving in the sky. Lots of things going on. And so I want to focus on Being as attentive and being as Present as I can for that All right. So I think that pretty much does it? So here a few Key takeaways back to patterns again Whenever you're out in the field

00:49:42.000 --> 00:50:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Look for patterns. Patterns are a very powerful way to simplify your composition. Many of us, myself included. We struggle with Ah! Clutter, or with an image that's too busy Look for patterns, and if there's a pattern that requires you to use a smaller focal length, then go to a smaller focal length Tighten up your image so that you Make the pattern more Part of the image And that will allow whatever isn't a part of the pattern, an accent, or a disruption

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: As I showed you to become more the focal point You can use patterns again to create Movement in your image. This is very important, because When I talk about the principle of Lcu right leading the viewer into the image to the center of interest. Well, the way you lead them Different ways of doing that. But pattern is definitely one of them. And If you can change the variation of the pattern. And of course I mean by how you frame where you place your camera. What part of the scene

00:50:47.000 --> 00:51:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You photograph what part of the scene you focus in on. If you can find things in the pattern that change I tend to Go towards those I'm attracted to those Because that allows me to create some A change in tempo And This could be done in many different ways. Right? If you're photographing patterns in an urban scene Maybe patterns on the side of a building Buildings tend to reflect other things if the buildings are made out of glass. And so if you find a reflection, that's a great way to create

00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A, Um An accent, point a way to disrupt the pattern If you're photographing a pattern of windows, and one of the windows is slightly different. Then that's something you can anchor on If you're in nature, and you're photographing trees, look for variations in the trees, and how you can make those variations Explicit in your image By that I mean, make the variation obvious. Make it so that it's very easy to see. Oh, here's a few trees, and then this 4th one

00:51:44.000 --> 00:52:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: As a different Leaning to it a different gesture. These 4 trees all have different spacings between them. That'll allow you to create patterns that are much more organic And Much more interesting, versus Patterns that are static Nothing wrong with static patterns. They have their place. If you're trying to create an image that's very abstract. I think it's much harder to create an image That tells a story. When the

00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Pattern is very abstract, unless you're just going for a very random kind of of a Of a feel for the image of a What you're trying to share with the viewer And, as I said before, yeah, leading the viewer That's really the most important thing Always think about. How you think the viewer is going to Follow the pattern, or look at the pattern. Because that will allow you to dictate, if you will

00:52:37.000 --> 00:53:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The viewers. Path through the image And um That helps you tell a story When you can lead them to your center of interest, and everything feels unified. That's again the Lcu That's when you have a greater chance. You Increase your chances of a successful image All right. Any um Any questions on any of that, or

00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Any feedback or suggestions or comments, anything at all. With patterns.

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:22.000
steve guercia: Hi rob um This is kind of Disrupting how I've always used the word patterns

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Mhm.

00:53:22.000 --> 00:53:51.000
steve guercia: Um. I've always thought of a pattern Um From School many decades ago, but in set theory, in math That you have sets of numbers, and to have a pattern There needs to be a rule, a sequence, a relationship And when I look at some of these pictures, my 1st thought was There's a bunch of rocks There's a group of trees. There's a

00:53:51.000 --> 00:54:17.000
steve guercia: Collection of shapes, and I struggle To see. Formula, if that makes sense So. In in terms of using patterns to take Pictures. Um. Do I need to think about that differently? Do I need to put those Old math relationships. Aside, and not

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.000
steve guercia: Look for something so structured.

00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Well, that's a great question. And you mentioned a few words there. So one word that you mentioned was formula And I don't know that that's a proper word to use, or a word that I would That I would. That, I think, is set useful. Remember in mathematical concepts you have a pattern that Is. Very formulaic right in photography or in art. That's

00:54:47.000 --> 00:55:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Sort of what, not what we're trying to avoid. We're trying to avoid formulaic. So I guess a way of thinking about it is, think about patterns in math versus patterns in nature. Now you can represent the patterns in nature through math But nature has a way of creating patterns that Ah! Can be. You know. Think about a seashell, or something like that, right? Even though they're a pattern. But they're not static patterns. By static, I mean, they don't repeat in the same sequence of the same interval Okay. And that's what I was talking about in terms of creating variation

00:55:21.000 --> 00:56:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Through patterns. I think the concept of pattern is the same. It's something that repeats at some interval But you can be creative. You can be flexible, you can be. You can take liberties with the interval Or another way of saying it is Another way of saying it is perhaps because I always get I always get a little tied up with when I talk about creating this or creating that when you're taking pictures. In fact, we're just taking pictures of something that's already created yet You are, in a sense. Creating something through the frame. So this is a concept that we all need to understand that. You know, when you use a camera You, you impose an artificial Rectangle.

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: On the world Okay. This rectangle is artificial right? That's not how we normally see. We generally have this 180 degree depth of field But this rectangle, now Creates a pattern where maybe a pattern didn't exist before, because you're isolating it or the pattern existed. But you're just not isolating it to that area So. I would say I would say, don't You know. Don't get hung up too much on mathematical patterns. Think about

00:56:34.000 --> 00:57:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um The simplest way to think about it is Fine things, or Photograph things or use repeating elements. As a way to a create simplicity, because Humans love patterns. Right? We seek patterns. We're pattern recognition machine because it gives us a sense of comfort It gives us a sense of stability when things are random. It makes us feel very uncomfortable when we see a pattern. Okay, I understand the pattern now right So you can use that pattern to create a sense of simplicity in your image, and then subtle variation, meaning

00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Looking at the scene Whatever that scene is. Subtle. Variation will then allow you to emphasize parts of this rectangle of the photograph, so Imagine. Imagine um Oh, a line of cars! Right, and mathematically they are the same distance apart. Okay, that's a pattern And there may be a formula to it, but the formula has them repeating at regular intervals, and so to the viewer it may be interesting, just a series of cars. But if you find a break in this pattern that makes it interesting, or a little bit more interesting Is, that

00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Does that make sense

00:57:47.000 --> 00:58:05.000
steve guercia: It it does it Still makes my head hurt a bit Um So am I. Correct, then, that the this The skill that has to be learned Is finding these patterns that the viewer will also recognize

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Well, the viewer, the viewer will recognize it

00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:06.000
steve guercia: Because, if

00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The viewer will recognize it because of your photography. All right, the viewer will see

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:21.000
steve guercia: But but that's what I'm saying. I think that's the important part that if if I just take a picture, a bunch of rocks

00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, yeah.

00:58:21.000 --> 00:58:32.000
steve guercia: I might see a relationship going through there. But if it's too random The viewer of that photograph might look at that and say, well, that's just a bunch of rocks. They don't see the relationship

00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Sure.

00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:40.000
steve guercia: Then am I correct that Then I missed the pattern, or I didn't properly interpret the pattern

00:58:40.000 --> 00:59:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So, yeah, so I think I would. I would suggest that If you photograph, if you photograph a bunch of random rocks That isn't a pattern All right. That's the difference between a pattern and a non-pattern that a random, a group of random rocks Become organized in some pattern That's every picture that I showed you today. They weren't random rocks. They may have been random rocks in terms of nature, right placing them where they were, because nature is not placing them in some Some pre-ordered mathematical sequence.

00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But Random might have been all the rocks that you did not see, that were left out of the frame, and the rocks that were placed in the frame were placed because they did have a certain Pattern to them, so the pattern could have been that here's 4 rocks, and they all kind of look the same But they have different sizes, and the sizes change in some predictable manner. So if you go back to that original Um Let me go back to this image here, and maybe this will make some Here's an example of This up.

00:59:53.000 --> 01:00:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Painting that I showed you at the very, very beginning. All right. Are they random or Is there some kind of an orderly Pattern that you can see in them. It's clear to see that the ones in the front Change in an orderly fashion towards the rear It's not random. If it was random, then we would have big rocks back here, mixed in with the small rocks All the rocks in the back, or all the shapes in the back, are Smaller, and as we move to the foreground they get bigger That is a

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That is a Fairly predictable pattern Now There may be variations in that pattern, but the overarching pattern, I think, is there. And do you? Does that make sense

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:58.000
steve guercia: Yeah. And and I clearly see a pattern here Um And it obviously it doesn't have to be the same to be a pattern even in math But the the picture you put up of the Rocks, in the water. In the foreground With the line of trees on the shore in the background.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The black and white

01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.000
steve guercia: Um

01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Let's see, I think you're talking about

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:03.000
steve guercia: I don't think it was black and white

01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This one here Let me change it. Here, is it this one? It's not changing on me. Let me go back here This one.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.000
steve guercia: Yeah, I guess it was that one

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:26.000
steve guercia: Um I don't see a pattern in those rocks I see a bunch. I see the patterns in the trees

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Right.

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:33.000
steve guercia: And all the vertical lines in those relationships But I see A bunch of rocks.

01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Well.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:02:02.000
Mildred Salas Yip: I think the pattern is also formulated by the fact that you have lights and darks There are 3 rocks. That almost create a triangle shape. By virtue of where they're placed, but also because of the brightness And then the other rocks. Work against that same Pattern.

01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Right. So there's One pattern. And Right. There's another pattern So these the the rocks in red. Are different, and they create this Right. Pattern of threes. Right threes are very powerful, those 3 rocks stand out amongst the others. Would you not agree

01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.000
Mildred Salas Yip: Yes.

01:02:36.000 --> 01:03:01.000
steve guercia: Yeah, and and and those A very visible. I've I've tried taking similar pictures Where the sun is coming across the top of the water. And it's not quite hitting the water yet, but it's hitting the tops of rocks, and you get this kind of Sequence. Um I mean. Sometimes Robert wrote it It reminds me of The zodiac

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Mhm.

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:08.000
steve guercia: Where somebody 5,000 years ago looked at a bunch of stars And drew a line over it.

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, well, that's exact.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000
steve guercia: And gave it a name.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, that's exactly. But that's exactly it

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:13.000
steve guercia: But if you look at it without the lion.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Sure.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:19.000
steve guercia: There's no relationship there. Somebody just connected the dots and ignored the dots. They didn't want to see

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Right.

01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.000
steve guercia: So to speak.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah. Yeah. And and again, I think you've seen in all these pictures. There are

01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:22.000
steve guercia: Um

01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: There are some patterns that are Clearly obvious and very Visible, and others that are much more subtle If you asked me about this picture directly, I would say that the pattern is much more visible in the trees than it is in the rocks, for sure. All right. So I'm not arguing that the Pattern in the rocks is just as strong as the trees. The trees is much are much stronger I just think that he Sort of continue that in a very subtle fashion. So you can have suggestion. Right? You can have implication Where in math you

01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I guess it's much harder to do that I wouldn't. I wouldn't get too tight, so I wouldn't get too hung up on the The foreground, here. That's arguable. It still provides an entrance into the image, and the main pattern here is definitely established And so I think that's I think that's what's what's most important

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:21.000
steve guercia: And that is indeed how I see this. I see the rocks almost like stepping stones.

01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, that's fine. That's perfectly

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:27.000
steve guercia: To bring me into that shore, and those strong trees right in the middle

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah. Yeah. Yep.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:32.000
steve guercia: And then they were also reflected In the water. Um Last question on this

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Sure, sure.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:59.000
steve guercia: What? What would be? What would need to be What would need to be present in the foreground of that picture To for you to look at that and say, Wow! There's not a pattern there that's just a bunch of rocks Like if there were 5 more rocks in there. Or if there were 5 less rocks. But what's I'm struggling with? What's the difference?

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:55.000
David Luery: Walk.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:03.000
steve guercia: Between a pattern And not a pattern

01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Well. I would argue, I would say that This part of the image If that if that was the only part of the image that Existed. If that was the image itself, I would say I would say it really wasn't a pattern. I would probably put that on a very, very low Very low scale of actually being a pattern compared to the other things in the other pictures that I've shown you where there were clearly patterns So. The. Upper portion of the image is what establishes a pattern, and I talked about the rocks in the foreground as leading into this stronger pattern on top

01:05:38.000 --> 01:06:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I think, probably, what establishes it. If you took away these Reflections. Right then there would probably be no pattern at all, and it would be much more random Or if you had a few more rocks. That we're blocking these reflections. Maybe one over here something like that. See, I can make this much more random Right, and that you could see already if these were rocks It just feels more random. Now. Okay. If I take those away, then there's a little more of a design I wouldn't use this as a signature

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Image for patterns with the rocks in the foreground. It was just Really talking about the whole image Um. I think a A much better image. Um Would be. Let me just go over this one up here Where is that? Here. Switch back

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: All right. Is that clearer to you, this one here

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:47.000
steve guercia: Yes.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:07:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay, so that's what I would If you're struggling with patterns, then forget about that image and Focus on Images or ideas, or things, that you see a much clearer Sense, of Repeating. Repeating patterns. For me. I don't really think of patterns that much, because one of the things that I discovered when I was putting the images together for this

01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: For tonight's session was that I'm always thinking in patterns like, that's just a constant thing in my mind. So I don't have to actually say, Okay, let me think about patterns. Now. I discovered looking at my pictures. How much patterns are a part of how I photograph And then I just try to make that a part of a part of the image. So for me this was More about the interesting shapes And how the shapes repeat. But see, I'm using that word, repeat, and whenever there's repetition There's a potential for a pattern. If the repetition has some

01:07:49.000 --> 01:08:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Kind of Predictability to it. And so These rocks, here All of the same size. Then this one here And this one here, sitting on top of the others, repeating The. Pattern, repeating this sense of more rocks sitting on top of more rocks

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Are they random? Well, they may be random if you just stepped out into the scene, but once you impose this frame on it. Then I am Creating a pattern where I mean, there's another boulder over here. There's another one over here Maybe not out there. That's the ocean. But there's another one over here, you see. I've decided to Limit The viewers. Perception. To an area that is much more identifiable as a pattern, and then as a photographer, you have the liberty of making that pattern

01:08:40.000 --> 01:09:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Very distinct and very clear and very regular. Or irregular, as I mentioned before, and I tend to go to irregular. I like to push the extreme. I like to try to Make the patterns as non-obvious as possible. That's just my My um! You know my, my my approach, I suppose? Whereas in an image like this. You can see That It's still random, but there's certainly a pattern there, right? It's just beaks on top of beaks on top of beaks right

01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um And this one is particularly random. I don't think you could really find a mathematical formula to represent, because you can just You just kind of intuit that if you've got a bunch of birds Hundreds of birds. That's going to be quite random. And yet the pattern is what the pattern is not The spacing. The pattern is the repetition of the same subject, the same thing The beaks. In this particular case. I think it's the beaks that you see Most prominent right? That's the shape that stands out. So think of it like taking, you know.

01:09:49.000 --> 01:10:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A bunch of Triangular shapes, and just throwing them And the pattern is the fact that they are repeating in a very random fashion, but in a very Random, but also predictable right, predictable in the sense that I don't have to show you this part of the frame or this part of the frame for you to kind of know What you're going to see You're going to see more of the same

01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Harry Joseph: Hey, Robert

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yip!

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:16.000
Harry Joseph: Uh! What would you consider a sinewy road

01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, I saw your comment, Harry. Thanks. Yeah. I was going to get around to that Um. I would just call that more of a curve. I don't think I would call that a pattern. A pattern tends to be an element that repeats If I had a a road, that kind of snakes through an image That would just be like a like a like a curve, a line that you know, that curves

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:33.000
Harry Joseph: Right.

01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So, yeah, I tend to think of That is like a curving kind of Shape. Whereas a pattern is Is a repeating element that repeats in some

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:50.000
Harry Joseph: Like repeating element, right.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:11:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Something that repeats right. If you've got 3 roads That. Then that's a repeating element. Right? That's a pattern. If you've got You know um Lines. In the snow, or lines in the ice, or lines in the sand or waves on the beach. Those are repeating elements. Those are patterns. All of us have been to the beach, and you see the waves rolling in and rolling out, and we see these patterns, and we're mesmerized by them right the waves, and how they move together

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:11.000
Harry Joseph: Yeah.

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And how they change their orientation, their shape. Maybe you could Express that mathematically. Fluid dynamics I don't know, but Um But uh I would I would!

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000
Harry Joseph: Business.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I would be more, I would be more um to um Steve's point. Just be more loose with it, and Um, just, you know. Just let your eye kind of guide you Yeah. Yeah. Harry.

01:11:40.000 --> 01:12:00.000
Harry Joseph: Uh, yeah, this is truck dealership uh in my area, and I pass by it all the time. And there's uh About maybe 20 trucks lined up right next to each other, but they're all different colors. And I can't get to that picture, because, you know, it's right on the highway But that would that be

01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, sure.

01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:01.000
Harry Joseph: Definition, of

01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, you, yeah, you you saw, yeah, you're seeing it already. Absolutely. Yeah. Yeah. If you've got, you know

01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:02.000
Harry Joseph: Yeah.

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: 20 trucks, or 20 cars, or 20 people But they're all wearing different clothes. The repeating thing is the subject, the people. But the changing element is the colors right? Um An example of that is 4 foliage. Right? You photograph 4 foliage. You've got a A up. Colors right? A blanket of colors, and the colors change, and how you capture that pattern Will determine whether it's interesting or not, if it's just all orange. But if you've got orange interspersed with yellows interspersed with some greens Then that creates

01:12:42.000 --> 01:13:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A pattern that has some change to it, and you can Lead the viewer to the areas where they change, based on how Strong. You make those changes Um I'll show one more image, and then I'll We'll finish it up for tonight. But Let's see um There's 1 image here that I showed early on of for this very reason. Here it is So here's

01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A great example of that Um Steve. Right. These trees are not Randomly placed in the image right There's your 3rd There's another 3, rd There's roughly a 3, rd and roughly a 3rd

01:13:29.000 --> 01:14:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And The spacing of these trees Has a particular Random pattern to it. But They're repeated enough where it establishes some predictability. Right? We know that these are trees, and they extend into the forest into the distance And now you can feel that that has a sense of unity to it. Right? You're not thinking. Oh. Are there? What's in the background? Right? The pattern has established that the tree this is a forest And therefore you're no longer thinking about the background you are assuming

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You're being led through suggestion that there are more trees In this forest. And Here is a pattern of Colors, if you will And they're punctuated by little highlights where the light is Picking up. The tree. So that's creating A change. So here's a little highlight here. Here's a little highlight here

01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Here's what I highlight here. And then you've got these darker areas And then he repeats that In the foreground. Not so much, but at least the colors repeated. So you cut Again a repetition of the pattern. The pattern could be This warmish orange and yellow throughout the entire frame, from the top all the way to the bottom Okay, that's A repeating element, if you will, you can call it a pattern, but I think the pattern is more established in the foliage And then in the trees.

01:14:54.000 --> 01:15:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: All right, so They're very. Fluid and Uh Very fluid. And suggestive ideas that are involved here. It's not as mechanical as As as maybe you might think in terms of Of mathematics. All right. Everyone. Thanks for

01:15:20.000 --> 01:16:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: For being here tonight. Thanks for the great question. Great questions. Mark in math. It is called Fourier Series. Yeah, I've heard of that term. But I'm not sure what that is in periodic function. Yeah, those sound like programming terms or engineering terms. So I'm not sure. But thanks, yeah, that that That sounds about right All right. Everyone. Thanks for joining me tonight. I hope you enjoyed that, and for sure we will continue our discussion of Pattern and rhythm and composition in the future. It's a never ending thing that we're always we're all learning so Hopefully, that will be helpful. And yeah. There's no one else. All right. See you one next time Take care!
