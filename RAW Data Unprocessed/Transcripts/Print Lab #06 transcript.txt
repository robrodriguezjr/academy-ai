WEBVTT

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: All right. Everyone welcome. Let me um.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: There we go!

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Welcome, everyone. Welcome to.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Our print lab number 6.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In the Academy. Great to see everyone here joining me tonight.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Talk about one of my favorite topics, which is.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Printing and all things, papers and printing and.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um, the.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: What I think is the unique aspect to photography, which is, we can create this physical.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Three-dimensional thing from our.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Digital images that often seem kind of ephemeral, and, you know, locked in our computers, as it were, in our monitors.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Just going to wait a few minutes to get.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Some of the folks to join.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Welcome. Jerry and Al Brian.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Carl, David.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Joanne Karen Kerwick.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Welcome, Mike, Mildred! Welcome, Patricia! Welcome, Steve!

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Virginia.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Printlab Sessions. If you're new to the Academy.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Or if you haven't been to a print lab session before. As I said, it's all about printing.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Felt that it was. It would be a good idea to move this to its own separate session, so that we can.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Just talk about this on its own, and.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Discuss all of the different aspects of printing.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um. It's perhaps I could say it's a little more laid back, so feel free to turn on your cameras if you like, or if you want to unmute your microphone so that we can have conversation and discussion.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I am not, as some of you may or may not have noticed. I am not very good at keeping track of the.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Questions that come in the chat. I try very hard to look over there, but.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I keep moving it closer and closer to my field of vision, so that it can like.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Stand out to me. But of course there's always something else that takes away my attention. But.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You can leave comments that's perfectly fine. But again, if you want to.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Just just speak up and use your mic. That's perfectly fine as well.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Let me just make a little adjustment here to my.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Set up.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: All right, so.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Minimal space. Here, there we go.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Welcome, Tamra! Welcome, Tom!

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Welcome Virginia.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So to get started, I.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Thought that the general theme of tonight's.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Session would be papers.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I just gave or 2 weeks ago seems a lot more than 2 weeks ago now, but 2 weeks ago I gave a webinar to Canson.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: For Canson about papers and Matte papers in in particular.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I just figured that I would sort of rehash or review some of that information here.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: For those of you who didn't catch that webinar, and even if you did, I have more freedom and flexibility here to.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Get off the script, as it were, or.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Just explore different ideas, so I feel much more comfortable doing it with all of you here in the Academy.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But before I do that I do have some questions that came in.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um. So I think I'll go over those. And sometimes the questions.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Can also take us in different directions.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um as far as the um.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Any session, really, but particularly the print lab and the Q. And A, you're welcome to send questions in via email.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You can leave them on the. There's a form on the dashboard and the website that you can also post questions there.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Any way you get them to me is fine. I you know I don't really care as long as I get the questions, and I can.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Try attempt to give you an answer, and if I don't know, then obviously I don't know. But maybe I can point you in a direction where we can all find out the answers together.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So a couple of questions that came in from Joanne. Some of these, I think I should be able to get through fairly quickly but hopefully for you, there'll be.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: For others, it'll be useful as well. So.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Joanne says, I often print 11 by 17 and select paper type tabloid. Is this correct? Or should I be creating a custom size.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So the only time you want to create a custom size is when you.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I want to print that a size that isn't part of the.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Default sizes and the default sizes typically are.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: European, a 4, a 3.

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A 3 plus a 2.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And they translate to us sizes as 8 and a half by 11. That's a default size.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Sometimes you'll see it called letter.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You can select the letter. Nothing wrong with that. It's just a short can, for in half by 11.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You'll see tabloid. That's 11 by 17. Nothing wrong with selecting tabloid, if your paper is, in fact, 1117.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: 1319 is a 3 plus.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And so sometimes you'll see a 3 plus sometimes you'll just see 1319, and 1722.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Is the largest size. Sometimes you'll see that listed as Ansi, CANS. IC.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But you typically will see the size after that, the 17 by 22. So yeah, you can just select the default sizes.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The only time you make a custom. Size is custom, like note cards that have, you know, um.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Non-standard sizes, or you just you just have a piece of paper that you have to a particular size, 1015, 1113, and a half, whatever it is.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But I would say 99% of the time.

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You're going. If you're buying paper, if you're buying commercial commercial paper from any manufacturer.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The built-in standard sizes are fine.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: When calibrating. Should I be selecting Srgb. Or adobe RGB.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That's a bit of a confusing question, because I'm not sure what you mean by calibrating. The only thing that you.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Can be calibrating, I would assume you're calibrating. Is your monitor.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Unless you have a a way to.

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Well, actually, yeah, even even for papers that's profiling, not calibrating. So when you're calibrating.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If that's what you mean, you want to be selecting the the profile for your monitor. So if your monitor is a.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Wide gamut monitor. If that's what you have purchased, then that's going to be adobe 98.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Or adobe. RGB, that's a wider color gamut.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If it's a standard computer monitor, then it's probably going to be Srgb.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And sometimes, or actually, I don't know if I should say sometimes. But typically in the calibration software.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You'll see native and native means, whatever it is that is native to your monitor.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And so, whatever it is.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It'll it'll select, you know. It'll use that so that if your monitor is a white gamut, then it'll know that natively it's a white gamut monitor.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Another question.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And there are no dumb questions because she listed here. Probably a dumb question. If you have the correct paper size and page settings.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Why do I still have to set the printer to the correct paper size, or do I.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And the answer is, you do not. Okay. So.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um lightroom.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And perhaps Photoshop as well, and other software. They control.

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The printer. So you.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The only time you're going to use the.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Paper selection on the printer itself on the printer's LCD. Is.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I don't know. Perhaps if you're printing from your ipad or iphone, or something like that.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But if you're using Lightroom or Photoshop, or.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Canon, print and layout.

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Once you select the paper size in the software, then you don't have to do anything on the printer's display.

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Set setting paper says, even if even if even if the printer says 8 and a half by 11, and you're using 1319, it'll.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It'll know that it's 1319. The only time that there's a slight caveat to that is that on canon printers.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: When you are printing matte papers, when you're using matte papers on a canon printer.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You have to go over and hit. Ok.

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Once. The print is, you know, the job is sent from the from your computer. For some reason.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You have to come over, go over and still press the Ok. Button when you're using the sheet feeder.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: No need to do that. So kind of strange.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Another question out of gamut warning.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So that is, let me jump in here real quick, and just show that very quickly. If I come. If I open up lightroom here.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I don't know if it'll happen here, but if I select this image.

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I go into the soft proof.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay. Sometimes, if I come up here and.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Uh.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Turn this on, you'll see the out of gamut warning here, and that it's showing you colors.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That will not print.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Onto the paper that you have selected here in your. You know the paper that you have here for your profile. So different papers.

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Here we'll have different.

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Capabilities in terms of the colors that they can reproduce.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And typically Matte papers will have a slightly smaller gamut than non Matte papers.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Gamut means the.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Number of colors that they can print.

00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And so you'll get this warning, and this warning just shows you the this red overlay shows you the colors.

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That are out of gamut, meaning your printer. Can't your paper.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Can't quite reproduce those colors.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um, that's not nothing to really worry about. I do not try to adjust my color settings here to bring those colors back into gamut, because then you're also.

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Affecting other colors in the image. It's not an exact, precise color selection.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That is what a good profile is, for a good profile will take those out of gamut gamut colors.

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And translate them.

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Or compress them into the color, gamut.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That the paper supports and.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In theory, and typically it works out.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You'll get colors that look precise. So you know this green here, perhaps, and let me turn this back on again.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know some of these oranges here.

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Or these greens that are slightly out of gamut.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The profile will translate them, convert them so that they.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Will print a color that the paper does support.

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And honestly, the the differences are so so so minor, that you probably won't notice anything. So really I wouldn't worry about.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The out of gamut warning.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then one last question from Joanne, what is finishing options?

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In my canon, printer.

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So finishing options might be talking about the gloss optimizer or the chroma optimizer that the canon printer can apply.

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To the surface of a print.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That is typically used when.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If you imagine now that you're printing onto a.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Gloss paper, a gloss, type, paper.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And you have something in the image.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That is brighter than the papers.

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Natural color. It's not going to put any ink there because.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It can't get as bright, and so it'll leave that area of the paper without any ink, and.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If you look at it at an angle, you can actually.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Tell where the paper has ink and where it doesn't have ink, and that's called.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Actually, I forget what that's called. Now it has a particular name. If someone remembers what that is, please.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Please let me know. I forgot exactly what that's called.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um. But you'll get this little.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Weird area that doesn't have any ink. And canon printers and Epson printers now as well have something called a chroma optimizer. And that's basically a think of it like a.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Clear coat that can be applied over the top of the paper.

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So that you don't get that area that doesn't have any ink, you know. It's like a finishing.

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A finishing.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Ah coding.

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In canon printers. You can set that to automatic, or you can set it to on automatic means. The printer driver will kind of.

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Determine or guess when it should use, that.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You can also set it to on, and that means that.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: For that particular printer will always apply that.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Gloss optimizer or the chroma optimizer.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: For me, I typically leave it on automatic.

00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And if I have an issue with a particular print, then I will turn it on, but otherwise.

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I leave it on automatic, and I'm careful with.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Images that have very bright areas.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And when I'm printing onto a gloss paper.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So an image like this, for example, the one that I was shown before.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This won't have this issue, because nothing here is.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Really bright, or going to go beyond the brightness of the paper.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But it could happen with things like really blown out highlights. That's the classic example.

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If you've got blown highlights, and that doesn't have to be, you know. It doesn't have to be mistakes. It could be like bright lights, you know, in a city scene or.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The the sun, for example. That's a classic. If you got the sun in your in your picture.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That's going to be blown out right and.

00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: On a matte paper. It it just blends right in. It looks nice on a gloss paper. You'll have an area depending on the color of the sun. If it's white.

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Then that'll be blown out, and you won't get any ink there, and that could look a little strange. So that's what that gloss optimizer is for.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: All right. Um.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Tamara also sent in a question which I want to address towards the end, because.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I think it'll relate to some of the stuff we'll be talking about today in terms of papers.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Anybody else have any questions.

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Along these lines or anything else that they want to ask very quickly as long as it's not well, yeah, any question is fine, really.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Any any printing questions.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:28.000
carlcascella: Robert, do you use that plugin extra thing for canon printers? Or do you go right from lightroom.

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um. I didn't catch the name of the Plugin that you said. Are you talking about the Canon Plugin, or something else?

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000
carlcascella: Um so.

00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000
carlcascella: When I was printing, I was getting really saturated areas.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000
carlcascella: In blue clouds. So I called Canon, and they said.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah.

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Oh, yes, Carl, yeah, I remember now. You're talking about the canon.

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Print um.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Print and layout software, the Plugin.

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.000
carlcascella: Right.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, I don't. I don't normally use that um.

00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But Carl is talking about an issue that he was having with a print where he was getting some super saturated parts in the sky.

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You called Canon. They told them to use Canon's Plugin, and I think you said that the problem went away right.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
carlcascella: Um. It's clear up a lot.

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay. Um.

00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:18.000
carlcascella: And it didn't happen. It was weird, Robert. It didn't happen with every print. It happens only with certain prints.

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Well, when you mean certain prints, are you saying with images, different images.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000
carlcascella: Right. It happened with.

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:33.000
carlcascella: Certain files, but not with others. Some printed like perfectly, and others had these super saturated areas in them.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, um. You know, it could be.

00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'm going to assume that because you installed the or because you used the Canon Plugin, and it went away, or or got a lot better, as you said, and it.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Was happening in lightroom. It could be a lightroom, pipeline thing, an adobe thing with.

00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The color management in lightroom, and maybe they've corrected that. In fact, there was an update.

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To lightroom a few days ago, I believe.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'm not sure exactly what it was, but.

00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Certainly not within, you know. Certainly within 2 weeks.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um. I want to say we're at.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Versions, 14.5.

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And they are not always going to tell you the bugs that they're fixing specific bugs. But I haven't tried printing since that update, and that's 1 of the things that I wanted to try.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That's sometimes that could be it. It could be just a bug in lightroom.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: With Mac OS, or sometimes a bug with.

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Windows, and those things get.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Fixed, but I would say that ideally you should not be getting.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Those kinds of differences between using a plugin and using lightroom.

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Adobe, of course, has engineers all over this, and they would obviously know if there was a deficiency, and they'd be fixing it right away. So.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But you know, if that worked for you, then great.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
carlcascella: Thanks. Thank you.

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah. Yeah. Anybody else.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:00.000
steve guercia: Rob uh apple recently, did an operating system update a week or 2 ago? Should we be.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah.

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000
steve guercia: Updating our printer drivers.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Well, so you asked me 2 questions there, Mac, operating system upgrade. So yes. In fact, I just installed 15.6 today. So that's Mac OS, 15.6.

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That doesn't mean that there's a printer driver update that has to come from your printer manufacturer, so they don't always.

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Like cannons.

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Driver is still the same that it was 6 months ago.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: All right. So um.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It's a tricky thing, I would say, if you go to. Let's say there's a let's say there's an update for Mac OS.

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And you want to find out if you should update, because you want to make sure it's not going to break your printer driver.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Ideally you want to go to. Let's say you have a cannon.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Or apps, and you want to go to the printers.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A manufacturer, site, page.

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Check the driver, and if the driver doesn't support the latest OS, then I would hold off until they do have a driver that supports the latest OS, otherwise.

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: There's a potential that it won't work. It doesn't mean it won't work, but there's a potential that it won't now.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'm always sort of on the bleeding edge, so I just installed the latest OS. And I haven't tried printing yet.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And it could be, Carl, that with the latest OS it fixes the saturation issue right? So there's always that kind of thing. I.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um. If you have something that's working, everything works perfectly. Then I would I would be a little bit.

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um careful. I wouldn't say.

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Afraid, but I'd be a little careful about updating.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You can wait a little while. Typically, these updates aren't adding anything that's.

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Mind blowing that you have to have right away, so you can wait a little while to get. You know the new.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Mac OS upgrade from 15 5 to 15 6 is some bug fixes and some little.

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Things that I probably won't really notice, anyway.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Anybody else.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: All right. Um.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So today I wanted to talk, or at least get into just talking about papers and and specifically.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Mad papers. As I said, I talked about this a few weeks ago, but I wanted to just sort of.

00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um share it with the Academy. So.

00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um. You can think of 2.

00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I've spoken about this before. You can think of 2 categories of papers, mad papers, and non-mat papers. Those are the 2 categories.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Non-met papers is an umbrella for an umbrella term for many kinds of papers. Gloss, semi-gloss, luster, satin, semi, you know all.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Semi-luster. All kinds of.

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Different names, fiber, barita, etc.

00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But the the um.

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Unifying quality is that they all have a.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Shinier surface, a some sort of reflective surface, more than a matte paper.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And second thing is that they.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Typically will hold more black ink, otherwise known as dmax. That gives them more contrast, and that creates a more.

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Contrasty look.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It gives you deeper blacks. It gives you potentially more separation in the shadows.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It's, and then we can talk about the.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Just the visual differences. Right? As I said. Contrast.

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then you can talk about the aesthetic differences. Right? So it's more.

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Ah, photographic looking right? And I'm using photographic, not in a derogatory term, but just in terms of.

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um, more like what we're used to seeing in terms of photographs. Very literal, very realistic, very.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Ah, punchy that those kinds of things.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then non-mat papers are papers that.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Will have Lower Dmax, so they won't absorb as much black ink. That's because of the surface. The surface tends to be cotton.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And the coating isn't as tight as the coating on a gloss paper. And so the ink spreads a tiny bit more.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It doesn't absorb the black ink as much.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And so you get less Dmax. But you also get that non-reflective surface which.

00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: From a visual standpoint, looks softer, it looks more.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Less contrasty.

00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Quieter, if you will, and aesthetically right.

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You start, it starts to look more painterly, more.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um fine art looking right. However, you want to.

00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Define that or think about that, but it looks less like a.

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Traditional, a photograph, and more like a.

00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Something that you know has a more finite look and feel to it.

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So here is just a quick diagram, right?

00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I'm going to use the Canson line because the cancel line is one I'm most familiar with.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But you can apply this to other paper manufacturers. They all tend to follow the same kind of idea right? They got their Matte papers.

00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And they got their non-map papers. Whether that's Hanamula, or whether it's Red River, or whether it's.

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Epson, for example. And so the in Canson's line, the Matte papers.

00:21:53.000 --> 00:22:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Are going to be less T-max and the non-mat papers again, Platine, Varida, Prestige, Photosatin. All these other names.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: They are going to be higher. Dmax.

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But this difference, this separation, again, from my point of view, from my from what I see, is the biggest difference. It's the thing that's going to give you the biggest.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Sort of uh.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It's going to give the greatest impact on your image.

00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: When you look at it, and when other people look at it as well.

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Now.

00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: As I said, Matte, finish less reflective, less Dmax.

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And the other benefit that you get with with Matte papers that you don't really get with non-mat papers is you get this.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Ability to have varying textures, different kinds of textures that can add.

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Dimension and depth, and a 3 dimensional quality to an image. And so you can go all the way from.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Arch 88, which is very smooth to something like arch. Aqua row.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Which is very textured and.

00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: These terms vary and.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know, smooth is smooth. Okay, that's that's pretty much. You can't see any texture at all.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And when I say very textured, I'm relating that to the line.

00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So very textured doesn't mean that it's as textured as a.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know, as a painter's canvas.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But within the range of the Canson line and other manufacturers are similar.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It's going to be very textured. And again, this gives you a more expressive kind of feel. If you will.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um. Mind you, this does not imply that the print is going to be.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Soft by that by soft I mean in terms of detail.

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You're not going to lose detail if you have an image that has lots of crisp detail in it.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You're still going to keep that crisp detail, even if you print it on Aquarel, at least with Canson, because the coding again does a fantastic job of.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Of maintaining the integrity of the little tiny dots that come out of the printer.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: There's another thing to think about very quickly.

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Modern made papers versus mold made papers. You may have heard these terms before, but Mold made means that the paper is made on a machine that uses this mold, which.

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Gives it a more random texture. The texture is random and more.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Analog looking, if you will.

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Whereas a modern paper made on a modern machine is going to give you a more.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Consistent surface. I like to think of this idea of like.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Digital versus analog, just as a as a mental model, if you will. As a concept, you know, the cylinder mode tend tend to be a little softer looking and feeling.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And you'll see Matte papers that will say mold made, and that's what that means.

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So in Canson's line. All the modern papers are up here meaning that they're made on the modern machine, the textures. And I'll show you some close-ups of the textures soon, and then the mold made. Papers are the most.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Fine art, feeling and looking the ones that are most.

00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Uh uh.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Supple in your hand. Okay.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So here's a couple of papers, so you can see what I'm talking about. This is Borida photography to Matt.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And this is probably cancel the smoothest paper.

00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And we're talking about Matte papers now. So all matte papers, this is their smoothest Matte paper that has the highest Dmax.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The Dmax is so high on this paper that I would say it's almost not quite, but almost as high.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: As a non-mat paper almost as high as Borida. That's how good this paper is.

00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It doesn't feel like a fine art paper. It doesn't feel like a cotton paper.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But it's a.

00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Ah, Matte, finish with an amazing amount of dmax, and I'll show you some examples.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So if you like the non-reflective surface. Okay, you don't like reflection on the on the, you know, on the print.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But you like the Dmax of a gloss paper. Then this is a paper that you should check out.

00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I, you know I can't tell you that this may be unique to Canson. A variety of paper that has a matte finish.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Alright. This next one is Rag Photographique 2. So they've actually released a new version of Rag Photographique, which is.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Really nice. You can see from the previous example to this one.

00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That this one you could just see that the surface isn't quite as smooth. Alright. So here's the previous one, very flat and smooth, and here you can see.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The surface just has a little bit of something. And as an example, this is the back of my viewing station, and has some.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It's just a metal that has paint on it.

00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And it's not perfectly smooth, but you see it has some little ripples on it. So this paper is pretty smooth.

00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um. So the right photographique is improved. More Dmax.

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Smooth surface, and that cotton feel this is addition etching. And here you can see what I mean about the.

00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Texture, being very sort of.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Uniform and patterned. It's not random. Okay? So you can see kind of it's a pattern that repeats over and over again. That's because it's a modern.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Made paper, not a cylinder mold made paper.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Now this is arch 88. Now we're getting into the mold, made papers.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And this one.

00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Smooth again, but it has just some surface variation. I don't really know what word to use.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Because the only real way to appreciate it is to just hold it in your hand and look at it.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But it's fairly smooth, very smooth, really nice paper.

00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If you're looking for something that is smooth, but also has the that maximum kind of.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Supple feel to it. Now, here's.

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Bfk, and you'll notice here compared to.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The addition etching that I showed you before. This paper is a mold made paper, and you can see that the.

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The texture on the surface.

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Is much more random. It's not like a pattern that repeats over and over again the textures.

00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Are random. They're more spread out.

00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And so that creates a much more organic looking feel to an image when you're adding texture to it.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I'll talk about.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Ideas about when you should or shouldn't, maybe should, is the wrong word.

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: When you might want to think about. Consider using texture versus not using texture.

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This is a newer paper that canceled on his release. Somerset enhance satin.

00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Again smoother, but with that very supple finish, so it feels more supple in your hand than something like rag Photographique, which feels more.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um stiffer.

00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Here is Somerset, enhanced velvet.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You can see again a much more random pattern, more spread out than the bfk.

00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Here is a watercolor. Somerset enhanced watercolor. This is the.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Most amount of texture that you'll see on a paper.

00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: On a Canton paper, this one and the next one coming up, which is Akuro. But again, it's similar.

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To the previous one, except that the texture is more pronounced.

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So it's has got deeper hills and valleys, if you will.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then the last one, which I think is probably the most textured, is aquarel.

00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And you can see it right away. How.

00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It has bigger, you know, peaks and valleys in the paper surface.

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: More random, more spread out.

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But, as I mentioned before, even with a detailed, an image that has detail in it.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It really does an amazing job preserving detail. I've seen images with insects.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Printed on this paper, and I was surprised at how sharp everything looked except that the paper adds this wonderful dimensional.

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Three-dimensional quality.

00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: By the way, if you're thinking about glass.

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay, remember that just because you put a piece of glass over something. Yes, of course you can't touch it anymore.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But just because you put glass on, it doesn't change the way the light bounces off of the paper surface, all right. And so you're still going to.

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: See and appreciate.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The texture because it changes.

00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The direction of the light. Right? It's much more random, and you can still see the the peaks and valleys.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If you look, you know, carefully enough, it still maintains not as much, of course, as without glass, but.

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You'll still maintain that it's not like it wipes out any surface.

00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Texture on the paper just by putting glass over it.

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Now, here's a little.

00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Ah sort of chart that I.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Sort of put together to get to give you a sense at least, of Canson's papers. Okay? And so if you think about the.

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This bottom axis here, as papers that are.

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Photographic, right? Meaning we're talking about Matte papers now.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Smoother, smoother, and more photographic, and then.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To the right side are papers that are.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: More textured.

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To maximal textured right.

00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: They give you a more fine art and painterly look.

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That's this bottom axis. And then from here this axis on the left is.

00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Papers that are warmer in tone.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To papers that are cooler in tone at the top.

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I chose these 2 sort of metrics because.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: They're the easiest ones to see. Right? You can see if a paper is cooler or slightly warmer.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And you can obviously see a paper that has texture and smooth versus a paper paper that has that is smooth with without any texture.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Versus one that has a lot of texture.

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And so these are how the papers lay out on this chart.

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Here's the Barita photographic mat that I mentioned that that was the 1st one I showed you.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It's the.

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Coolest paper, meaning it has the most neutral surface.

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So it's way up here, and it's the most photographic. So it's at the top left hand corner.

00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And if we come to the bottom right hand corner, you're going to get the paper that is the most textured and the.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Warmest in tone, and that's going to be the Somerset watercolor rag. Notice that if we go straight up.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Here's the aqua rollrag, meaning that it has the same texture as the Somerset. Yet it's much cooler.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Or more neutral in tone.

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Than the Somerset is.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then here are our papers that have less texture. Again.

00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Like Reich Photographique. That's very smooth, that is.

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That is neutral in tone as the Berita, and also has the cotton backing, so it.

00:31:50.000 --> 00:31:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Has a more organic feel to it.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This metal area. Here are the.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:32:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You can say the semi-textured papers, or moderately textured. I'm sorry they have texture, but it's moderate.

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And again from the warmest to the coolest. Up here.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then, as I mentioned these papers on the right-hand side.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: How do? How do? How might you use this, or.

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Maybe I come at it from a different angle. Which papers do I use, and why do I use them.

00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Well for the kinds of image prints that I like to make.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I want the maximum amount of contrast.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay, I want as much contrast as possible.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So it preserves my deepest blacks and my brightest brights. But I also want a matte finish. Now, that's me talking now, right, this is my kind of preference. So I want a matte finish. I like the softer look of Matte. I like the quieter look I like the more fine art. Look.

00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But once I.

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Decide that I want that I still want to have maximum contrast, and I want.

00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know the most amount of.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Uh uh.

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Dynamic range. And so I tend to stay.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In the top part of this graph.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So I tend to use variety of math. I tend to use Archie 88 a lot.

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Right Photographique. I love bfk pure white.

00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Not the normal white, and I'll show you some examples of that. The only difference between these 2 papers is that the pure white is a little bit whiter.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And when I.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Use a heavily textured paper like aquarel. I tend to like, you know, any.

00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Heavily textured paper. I prefer the aqua row over the watercolor, because again.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It's a little whiter, and that gives me a little more contrast.

00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If you like. Warmer type papers.

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And you like um.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Texture. Right? Then you'll be somewhere in this range.

00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Over here um.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If you want, you know, maximum contrast, for let's say, a black and white.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Image, then.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Brighter photography to Matte might be a good choice. And again, I'll show you some.

00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Show you some examples of that. So before I jump over to the.

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To my viewing station and show you some prints. Any questions on this, so far, any any.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Anything that um.

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That any questions from anyone.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Sure I hear. I sure yes.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:27.000
Tamra M. Gentry: Can you hear? It's Tamra um got a question when you say warm? Um, I mean what? What kind of I mean? I know that you mean like warmer temperature, like maybe like 22 K, or something like that.

00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:31.000
Tamra M. Gentry: I mean just throwing that out there. What's the range of warm? Um.

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.000
Tamra M. Gentry: To cool, for the papers.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, that's a that.

00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.000
Tamra M. Gentry: I mean, does it follow any kind of like scale like.

00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: No, no, no scale, and nothing like 2,200. That would be like like a paperback kind of yes, yeah. Way too warm. And that's good though I was. I was, in fact, I was waiting for someone to ask, What do you mean by warm.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000
Tamra M. Gentry: Super. Warm. Okay. Okay.

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: On it. So, as I mentioned before about, I think it was about texture. Right? It's all relative it's going to be. It's going to be relative to.

00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Each paper manufacturer when I mean warm is I need a word to.

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Describe what a paper that isn't as white as the bereiter is.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And so that's why I say warm. But the difference is going to be small, and I will show you when I go over to the viewing station. I'll show you exactly what that looks like between.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The coolest or the brightest paper and the warmest paper. Okay.

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:19.000
Tamra M. Gentry: Okay? I asked also, because um.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:29.000
Tamra M. Gentry: For instance. Um, I have a sample of Hanamula's agave paper, and it could be the actual image that's printed at the sunset with um under a wave.

00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Mhm.

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay.

00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:36.000
Tamra M. Gentry: It looks really warm, and I don't know if that was intentional, or if that's just the color that I mean that the tendency of the paper um.

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:40.000
Tamra M. Gentry: Um color wise, or what? But that that's kind of why, I was curious as well.

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, yeah, no, that's great. Yeah. I mean, it's it's hard to tell in those situations sometimes, because.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You have to consider. Is it the paper? Did they.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Warm, the image itself.

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: More to give it a warmish look to complement the paper. So it's a little bit difficult.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I think the best way to see this is to look at 2 prints.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: One printed on Bfk. White, and one printed on bfk. Pure white, the same image.

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then you can see the difference, and you'll see a little difference. But it's not like night and day.

00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So a lot of these differences like when you look at this chart here, a lot of the differences in this chart.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Are nuanced. They're very nuanced. They're not.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um like huge differences, which I think is.

00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I think it presents a challenge for a lot of us, because.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know, they're so close we're like, Gee! Is it really going to make much of a difference? And honestly, once you show it to the public. A lot of it doesn't make a difference. For example, I think.

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Most people won't be able to tell the difference.

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Once you put a print on the wall between Bfk.

00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: White and bfk Reese, pure white.

00:36:40.000 --> 00:36:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It's that close. But if you've got.

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The if you're the photographer and you are making a decision between buying the 2.

00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And you know that one is a little bit whiter, and you want something that pops a little more. Then go for the pure white right like it, doesn't. It doesn't cost you anything but.

00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If you print it on white like. For example, if I thought I was printing on pure white, and I printed on white by accident and didn't notice.

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'd probably have to look a few times to actually notice that it wasn't pure white. I would probably be fooled as well. It's that close.

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, okay. So I'm going to jump over to the.

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Viewing station very quick. I got a couple of prints on there. I'll take those down. I'll be right back.

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: All right, so.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Let me just check something. Here.

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: All right. So I cannot see the comments anymore. But I.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Can hear anyone. So please, just.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Speak up. If you want to ask a question or just shout out, and I will definitely hear you. Okay.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Let's take these down, because that is not for now and.

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Let me just show you 2 things here. So first.st

00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Just want to talk a little bit about texture. Right? So here are 2 images.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um.

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Same exact image, and.

00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The one on the right is printed on.

00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Bfk. Reeves, and it has some texture.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: One on the left is printed on Rag Photographique, and it has.

00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: No texture. So really, really smooth.

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: One on the right has some texture.

00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And in this case, for this image I would.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Probably, and in fact, I would.

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Use the textured paper. I would use a textured paper for this image, and the reason for that is because.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The image itself right, so the image itself should dictate to you. It should tell you.

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Whether you want to use texture on a paper.

00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So how do you decide that? Well, I have pretty much textured throughout the image. Okay, the whole.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Bottom half of the image is all texture, right? These grasses and.

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: All kinds of textural qualities.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The middle ground here, with the mountains that's all textured, and then the sky is also.

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Textured, and has, you know.

00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It's not smooth in any way.

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And so adding texture.

00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To the image with the paper isn't going to compromise any.

00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Big changes in texture in the image, because there are no big changes in texture. It's all texture top to bottom.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And the texture adds, this wonderful.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Dimensional quality. Right? So everything here, the grasses, everything just feels a little more.

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: 3D. If you will. And you can definitely tell. Okay, I can definitely see that in.

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And all my printing workshops. When I show people the differences.

00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You can definitely appreciate that. You know this one.

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Of course, looks great as well, but just not as.

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Dimensional. Okay? So that's when I would use texture.

00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Now, here's another example, all right, and.

00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'm just going to put them the same way. So the.

00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Smooth. On the left.

00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And the.

00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Textured on the right.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So again, this is same. 2 papers, different image.

00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Of course. Same 2 papers bfk on the right, and.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Rag photographic on the left, which is very, very smooth.

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And now it's different.

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The reason it's different is because I do have.

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Big differences in.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Texture in the image.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Right. So, in other words, the whole bottom of the image is smooth areas like water.

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: With textured areas like the tops of rocks.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then I've got textured areas over here on the left.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: With very smooth areas in the sky. In the previous image the whole sky was full of clouds. Here you can definitely see.

00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Smooth areas, nice, beautiful gradations. And so for this kind of image, I would not use a textured paper because the texture.

00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Basically negates or mitigates the differences in the texture.

00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In the image. In other words, if I put texture throughout, then you've got texture in the sky up here, you've got texture here. You've got texture in the rocks. You've got texture in the water.

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And so the this, the smoothness of the water, doesn't quite come out as well as it does.

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In this image, because here the water remains smooth.

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And whatever texture there is in the image is only in the places that are that are in the image. So, for example, just these rocks here.

00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So this difference, the texture on the rock versus the water is.

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Preserved in the in the textured paper.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The difference between the texture in the rock and the water isn't as preserved, because I'm adding texture.

00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: From the paper. All right. So that's generally how I think about.

00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Whether texture would complement my image, or whether it wouldn't. If you have.

00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Big differences in textured areas, in the image.

00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Particularly if you have very smooth areas.

00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The smooth areas are areas that recede into the distance because they're smooth and the texture.

00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Areas come forward because our eyes are more attracted to things that have some texture.

00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Therefore the smooth paper maintains that, or preserves that all right.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:15.000
steve guercia: Rob is the uh. The difference in the textures.

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Any.

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.000
steve guercia: The primary reason.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:24.000
steve guercia: The in the right photo you can see more detail and more rocks in that wooded area on the left.

00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Well, that may not be. Let me switch them around, and you tell me what you think, because.

00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I have a feeling that it has more to do with just my setup here with the camera. What do you think now.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, so, and I think that has to do with the lens that I'm using this lens on this camera. I think it has some fall off on the edges.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And so, yeah, that's why there's a slight difference between left and right. But.

00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Definitely. You can see here. Now.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Texture here is very pronounced, and.

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Smooth in the sky, in the background, so.

00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Any any other questions about texture. Specifically, I'll talk a little bit more about it as we look at some other papers.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay, so.

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:13.000
Ken Hoffman: Robert. I'm just wondering if um.

00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:18.000
Ken Hoffman: If you can talk a little bit about how you're thinking about um texture in.

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:21.000
Ken Hoffman: Um when when you're talking, when you have port.

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:27.000
Ken Hoffman: Portraits, or more people in your in your pictures, and and what.

00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:30.000
Ken Hoffman: Kind of things do you think about when you're when you're looking at whether.

00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.000
Ken Hoffman: But more textured paper would be a better fit.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, that's a i mean, that's a that's a.

00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know a question to think about, but I would suggest, or I would.

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I think if you think about it carefully right? So if you take the some of the ideas that I've just talked about before, and you shift them over to portraits. For example.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I think you would agree. For example, if you've got a picture with, let's say you've got a bunch of people.

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: 4, 5, 6 people. So you're not going to be zoomed in anyone's face. You're going to be kind of far away.

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Maybe texture there works because you're not really zoning in on smooth areas. So the smooth areas are not a big part of the image.

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But now imagine a a.

00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Portrait of a single person.

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay, and particularly if it's like, you know, just the head, and you know the head or the.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know, chest up, or or waist up.

00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The face now is going to be a much bigger picture, a bigger part of the image. And now you can imagine using a textured paper that makes the face look a big, textured.

00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You can use that.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To your advantage or disadvantage. Right? It depends on who it is. If it's a.

00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Grungy guy who's got a lot of you know, Big Beard, and his face is all textured. Imagine you could also.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You would be able to complement that.

00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If it's very smooth skin, if it's a baby, if it's a young person that has smooth skin, and you want to really preserve that softness.

00:44:54.000 --> 00:45:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I wouldn't use a textured paper. So I got many pictures of, for example, my kids, my daughter, when she was 2, 3, 4, 5 years old, and.

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Always printed on smooth paper, because.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know, that's what we that's what we imagine, right? And as.

00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And, as you know, as we get older, and you can imagine street images, older folks, and so forth.

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Then texture can play that role. So think about it the same way. Think about the textures in the picture.

00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And how they vary in the image. And then, whether you think that the texture would complement or take away from the image I mean, I think that's how.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: From A. That's the framework that I would use.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um. So this is Berita Photographique to Matte. So this is the paper that I mentioned to you is, has the highest dmax for any matte paper almost as close as ah as a fiber based paper, but still has.

00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A non-reflective, smooth surface.

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And you can see here that it does an amazing job for this kind of image where I really want to.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Feel the blacks pushing the light, pushing the energy of the light. And yet it's a matte. Finish.

00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Very smooth and very.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Cool or neutral, so see how white the paper is.

00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Now I'm going to bring up a.

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A warmer paper. Just to give you an example.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:16.000
Tamra M. Gentry: Robert, excuse me for a second. You said. That's the Kansas Kansan. Um rag Photographique.

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um.

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Beretor, photographic mat.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:20.000
Tamra M. Gentry: Oh, okay. Gotcha gotcha. Okay? Thanks.

00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, okay.

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So here is.

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A warmish paper.

00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay, so this is Borida. I'm sorry this is Bfk. Reeves.

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: White, and you can see that.

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It's not as white as this one.

00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But it doesn't look warm. It's just not as bright.

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Alright! So that's what I meant by.

00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:50.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I call it warm just to differentiate it. But the term warm. Don't think that it's going to have some kind of.

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Warmish tint to it. All right. It's just not as bright as this paper, not as cool.

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This is a little cooler. This is slightly warmer, but.

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um uh.

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Not drastically.

00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I'll put the 2 up next to each other in a moment.

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um.

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Here's another bright up Photographique.

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Matte, same paper again as before.

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Again. This is the one that has the.

00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Amazing dmax format paper, same thing.

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Very coolish paper.

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Maintains the whites and the blacks really well, great detail, great everything. The only.

00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I would say. The only thing that doesn't feel the same as most other Matte papers is that it doesn't have a cotton backing. So this paper has a resin coated backing, not a.

00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Not a cotton backing, so it doesn't.

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It's not a cotton base, so it doesn't feel quite like a cotton paper. It feels a little more.

00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Sterile if you will, but it gives you amazing.

00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Blacks, and contrast.

00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:57.000
Mildred Salas Yip: Robert question.

00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, yeah.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.000
Mildred Salas Yip: Um.

00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: How about this, or.

00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:03.000
Mildred Salas Yip: No, just about papers in general.

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Oh, wait! Go ahead! I'll go to the next one. Go ahead.

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:05.000
Mildred Salas Yip: Uh um.

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:11.000
Mildred Salas Yip: Sometimes when it's right out of the box, you know it, it'll have the.

00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:14.000
Mildred Salas Yip: Print this side up right.

00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:19.000
Mildred Salas Yip: But sometimes, if if for any reason, you're shuffling papers.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:26.000
Mildred Salas Yip: It's very hard to tell. Sometimes the difference between which is the printing side.

00:48:26.000 --> 00:48:33.000
Mildred Salas Yip: And which is not the printing side. I know that that's so basic. It could be a silly question, but.

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:36.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, no, no, it's not. It's not a silly question at all, and it's.

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:37.000
Mildred Salas Yip: I've had issues with that.

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, yeah, it's not a silly question at all, and I will give you the. I will give you the ultimate trick to find out.

00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Without a shadow of a doubt.

00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.000
Mildred Salas Yip: Okay.

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um, and I teach this in all my workshops, and the easy way to do it is.

00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If you want to be as sanitary as possible, you need to wet your fingers. Now. You could do that.

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know, without going to your sink, but I suggest you go to the sink, or just have a sponge or something.

00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But if you wet your 2 fingers, okay, just a tiny bit of water.

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.000
Mildred Salas Yip: Right.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And you squeeze the paper like that with both fingers wet.

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: When you let go one side will be sticky, the other side won't be sticky, and the side that's sticky is the side you print on.

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:16.000
Mildred Salas Yip: Ah, okay. Okay.

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: All right. So that's the easy way to tell. It happens to me as well, and I just do the finger test right the wet test. So you just again just squeeze it like that.

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:19.000
Mildred Salas Yip: Great. Thank you.

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And sometimes, if you know, you could actually like, I see it won't happen to me now, because my fingers are dry. But if my fingers were wet, you could actually, it would actually hang.

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It would actually hang on my thumb until it fell. And that's because that's the side that has the coating. And remember, the coating is designed to absorb ink from the printer.

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.000
Mildred Salas Yip: Right.

00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And so if you wet your finger, it's going to sort of stick to your finger, because it's absorbing the water a little bit, so I do it on the edge.

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:53.000
Mildred Salas Yip: Correct. Okay. Alright. Great. Thank you.

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, yeah, no, it's great.

00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Alright. So this is Rag photography. 2. All right. This is the new Rag photography paper that Cansan has released. It's not out yet to the public. I think it'll be out next month or so.

00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But super smooth paper.

00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Beautiful finish, and they've increased the Dmax or the blacks.

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And so you see, for an image like this.

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It just works really nicely.

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Smooth, so I don't interfere with the smoothness in the image.

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But I still get these darks and blacks, and I get the this softer.

00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: More fine art. Look, it's not as harsh or not as loud or not as photographic.

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: All right. And so that's why select. You know this. You see these buildings going into the fog.

00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: By not using texture. I let that fog just remain as smooth and as.

00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Sort of indistinct as possible, which is the way it was in real life.

00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um.

00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Now here are 2 prints, same exact print on Bfk. Reeves.

00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I'm just going to put them. I won't be able to show them both, but if I.

00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Just side by side. All right.

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So very quickly. This is Bfk. Reeves White, or let's just call it natural.

00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And this is bfk. Reeves pure white.

00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So this is the whiter of the 2 papers, and you can see here.

00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Maybe down here you can see there's a difference there. All right. This is a little wider. This is a little bit.

00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Warmer, if you will, but warmer, relative to this one.

00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And for a black and white print.

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Like I have here, I would.

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I would go for the I would prefer to use the pure white.

00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Even if, as I said before, I might even not be able to notice if I printed on the regular one by accident.

00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But if I print on the pure white, I'm just going to get a tiny bit more pop, a little more contrast.

00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And yet I can use a matte paper for this image where.

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I keep all my details and everything, but it has a softer, maybe a more filmic look to it.

00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Because the paper adds a certain dimensionality to it.

00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And this is on bfk, so it's got a little texture to it.

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But that's ah, that's what I'm talking about in terms of the of the warm versus cool. It's very, very subtle.

00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And again in this image.

00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Oops that happened last time lost that one.

00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In this image. I'm using a textured paper.

00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know, you could see that there's.

00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Smooth parts of the sky up here, so you might say. Well, wait a second, you said before. If you've got smooth areas and textured areas.

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That's true. Of course, this is art. It's photography. You can do whatever you want right.

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The sky is a small part of the image.

00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I've got some clouds up here. Your eye is not going to spend a lot of time up here. I don't mind if it has.

00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know, some texture up here. But really this is the part of the image that really pulls you in. And so I really want to have that texture in the foreground.

00:52:54.000 --> 00:53:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'm making a compromise. Right? You look at the whole picture. You look at what you're trying to say with the image.

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: This image is not about the sky.

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And so adding a little bit of texture, I think.

00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Promotes what it is that I'm trying to say and convey in the image which is.

00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Not only the lushness of the tones and the.

00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The the movement through the image. But of course the texture.

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Okay. Here is.

00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A.

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A more textured paper called Somerset Velvet.

00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And actually, it's like this. Yes.

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So this is called somerset velvet. It's a mold made paper, so it's got some texture, and the texture is very random and and.

00:53:52.000 --> 00:54:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And varied, and you can see now, or you can imagine, I hope, why I would want to use this paper, or think that this paper would complement this image right the whole image.

00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Is about texture.

00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And there's lots of texture in the image. It's not smooth, it's not glass-like. It's.

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Rough, and it's a tactile textural quality to the.

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:22.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To this rock that I wanted to capture in my image. That's that's what drew me in, not only the texture, but also the colors, and the bands, and all that.

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The paper just comes along and provides more of that sense.

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Of the of the.

00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Of the story of the image, if you will.

00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Here's another example. Same.

00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Idea.

00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um texture throughout.

00:54:43.000 --> 00:54:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Nothing that I need to maintain or preserve.

00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: To be smooth. This is Arch Aquarel. This is Canson's most textured paper.

00:54:51.000 --> 00:54:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And yet I'm sure you can see that. You know there's no lack of detail. There's nothing that looks.

00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Like it's missing detail or sharpness.

00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And again it just adds a very dimensional.

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Look to the, to the, to the print.

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:14.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I will show one more, I think. Here.

00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Back to a very smooth paper. Arch 88.

00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Not as smooth as rag Photographique, but very, very smooth.

00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:35.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Difference being this is a mould made paper. So it has this very supple kind of feel to it.

00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Feels really nice.

00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Blacks are wonderful. I'm getting the separation here that I want. I'm not showing or trying to convey detail in these dunes. I just want it to be sort of a.

00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Sort of a uh.

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A tonal, just enough tonal variation to maintain your eye moving into the image and up into the sky.

00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:59.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And the softness of the paper adds to the dreamy.

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Like quality of the image. And that's exactly what I want. That's the kind of the feel that I want to project.

00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But not textured.

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Because again, lots of I got some fog here and some clouds, and I just want to. I want that to all remain as soft as possible. A little bit of texture, I think, would be distracting in this case.

00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Because there isn't really a lot of texture in the image. It's more broader bands.

00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Of tone from shadow to highlight. So archa 88.

00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Is. I think.

00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Works really? Well if I printed this onto a non matte paper. So any non matte paper, you know.

00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Platoine, or Baraida paper, or.

00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Even a satin paper from any manufacturer.

00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It would, it would definitely pop more. It would have it would have more contrast. It would jump out more.

00:56:46.000 --> 00:56:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But if that's what you're looking for, if that's the the sort of the story of the image, then.

00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So be it. That's great.

00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I don't want that. I'm looking for something that is more.

00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Reflective, you know, more contemplative if you will. That's just.

00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That's just the thing that I want to project. And this is why I think.

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Printing and papers.

00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Are, give us so many opportunities right? Because they allow you to to really.

00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Tune in to the thing that.

00:57:16.000 --> 00:57:20.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Will complement your particular images, you can make it your own.

00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Instead of, you know, just.

00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Using something generic.

00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Any questions at all about that before I we wrap up anything about any anything else on the papers here.

00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Anything else you want to see.

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: All right, so.

00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Let me jump over back to my regular camera. Hold on.

00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:00.000
steve guercia: Rob. I think one of the things that.

00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:03.000
steve guercia: That might be helpful. Um.

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:06.000
steve guercia: And future printing sessions is to take.

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:08.000
steve guercia: The same photograph.

00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:11.000
steve guercia: And print it on maybe 4 or 5 different papers.

00:58:12.000 --> 00:58:19.000
steve guercia: To to see, and that's 1 of the things I've played with to try to learn which papers work best with which photos.

00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah.

00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:26.000
steve guercia: And then to see, yeah, here's why this paper is not best for this one. But if this is the look you want to get.

00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:29.000
steve guercia: And and see what those differences actually look like.

00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:32.000
steve guercia: This comparison has been really helpful.

00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah.

00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:34.000
steve guercia: To start to learn about the papers.

00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, yeah, that's great. That's a great suggestion.

00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I think that, and I and I you know that is a.

00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Definitely something to to think about. I think what I would say is one. It's very hard to do that over the Internet.

00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um. Some of the differences are hard to see. I don't know how much you're seeing in my camera over there. I have everything set up, as well as.

00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: As good as possible. There's nothing like holding the print in your hand to tell.

00:58:57.000 --> 00:59:05.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And the other thing that I guess I want to emphasize, even if you did that practice, and it is an excellent practice to do.

00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:07.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But what I want to emphasize.

00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Is the importance of.

00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Starting with a.

00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:19.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um, starting with some kind of a.

00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: An idea, and so.

00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:24.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: By that I mean starting with an idea of.

00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Of how you think this image would look best like what qualities it would have that you think would look best.

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: By that I mean, what is the image about? Really? That's the question I'm asking. So.

00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:40.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I hope that you hear that when I talk about, when I show my images, anyway, and I talk about my prints.

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'm trying to be very specific about.

00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It sounds like, I know I'm very intentional about exactly what I want the print to look like and say.

00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And that's not because necessarily I'm an expert in papers.

00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: It's because.

00:59:56.000 --> 01:00:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I'm probably an expert in my images, right? Because they're mine. And so.

01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I've thought deeply about.

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: What I want to try to do with my work.

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And that, I think, is the core idea. Here you should be, if anything you should. You know.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Aspire to be an expert in your images, and.

01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:25.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You know. To be honest, I don't think I've ever said that before this particular way, but that's something that I don't see. I don't hear people promoting this idea. You know everything is about.

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:31.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Shoot like this shoot like that look like this look like that. And I'm like, Okay, that's cool. But I'm never going to be an expert in Ansel's images, because.

01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:34.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Ansell was an expert in his images or.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Pick any other photographer or any other artist, for that matter.

01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Only you can be an expert in your images. If somebody else is an expert in your images, then something is wrong, right? Something is not quite right.

01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So, and the reason I bring this up is because if you.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Move in that direction.

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I can promise you that every other decision you'll make, whether it's choosing a paper.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:01:01.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Whether it's editing your image in lightroom, whether it's how to frame it, how to.

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Show it how to exhibit. It will be way easier.

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:09.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Because you will be the expert, right? You will know exactly how you want it to look and feel.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:17.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Like a you know, a brilliant director knows exactly what he wants the movie to look like, and so he knows when it's not right right, because he already has in his mind these kind of.

01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: A vision of what it should look like. Now I'm not saying that's easy. I'm not saying that.

01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Is something that automatically comes will come to you.

01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But I will say that certainly that's 1 of the.

01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Founding ideas for the Academy early on, and maybe I didn't. I've never expressed it that way, because it just seems intuitive to me. But one of the founding ideas is become an expert in your images.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And then everything gets a little easier, like, well, yeah, I like, you know, I can see how you can add more contrast.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I appreciate that. But that's not exactly what I'm looking for, or that's more than what I want. So.

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And those paper comparisons definitely actually become even more.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Useful, because you can instantly eliminate, you know a bunch right off the table and say, Nope, those 3. Sorry that's not.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: That's not what I'm looking for.

01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:13.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: One last question that I got from Tamara, which is, and I'll read it out loud here, if you don't mind, Tamara.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: She said, as part of my listing of available photography products. I'd like to offer a small series of open edition. Fine art posters.

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I don't want them to be on a regular flimsy, uberglassy poster type paper. I'd like them to have a finer.

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:29.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Print, look, and feel, but still be accessible, price-wise.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: They don't need to have. They don't need a heavy hand. A light to medium weight paper would suffice.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:42.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Um. So I jotted down something very quickly here, which is rag photograph, Eq. 2. Now, I don't know what size printer you have, so what's the size of your printer, Tamara?

01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:50.000
Tamra M. Gentry: Um. It's a i have a canon pro 3, 10, and a um.

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: 1319.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Tamra M. Gentry: Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yeah.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, 13 inch wide. Yeah.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So this.

01:02:54.000 --> 01:03:04.000
Tamra M. Gentry: But I probably won't be printing them myself. They'll they'll be, I mean. I'll do the initial prints myself, just to kind of see what I want. Um! How it looks, and then ship them off.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:02.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah.

01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000
Tamra M. Gentry: For larger sizes.

01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:08.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, I mean, if you're going to have them, if you're going to print them.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If you can have someone else print them, then, of course, then that's completely up to what.

01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: They offer, and what papers they have available, and so forth.

01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:23.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If you're going to print them yourself. I've actually done posters many posters in the past, and I've usually used something like rag Photographique.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:25.000
Tamra M. Gentry: Okay.

01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:27.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You can get that in a 220 weight and a 300 weight.

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And the 200 weight is a little bit lighter. It's slightly less expensive.

01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: But I love that because for everything you just said in that question, which is that it looked and felt really nice. It looked high quality.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: The finish was nice. It was smooth.

01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:45.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And for 13 by 19.

01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:48.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Let's see here, because I did a quick.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Search on the pricings prices here. So 13 by 19.

01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:58.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In 2 10. You're looking at 4 bucks, $4 per sheet.

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In 1319.

01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:03.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: So if you were doing posters, you know.

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Depending on what you sold them at.

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:10.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: You'd have to clear $4 a poster, but I'm sure you could definitely do that.

01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: For something that was like uh.

01:04:12.000 --> 01:04:16.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Fine, you know. Fine art, a fine art look and feel. I think I was doing.

01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: 1722 posters at 1 point, and then slightly larger. I think I was doing 20 by.

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:26.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: 20 by 30 posters, but that's when it had a larger printer.

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:30.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And so, you know, you're you're offering a higher end.

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:33.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Poster experience, as it were, versus something that you know.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:37.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Cheesy, glossy posters that we all know and love. So.

01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000
Tamra M. Gentry: Exactly.

01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:44.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah. So I would look at that. Yeah. And if you if you print them outside, I've mentioned this many times before, it's only because.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000
Tamra M. Gentry: Okay, thanks for that.

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: I've had amazing results with them.

01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:53.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And and everybody else that I've sent to them has also had good results. But if you want to print, I always recommend Whcc.

01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:57.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Whcc. Otherwise known as White House custom, color.

01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: There may be others, companies that are really great. I would love to hear if members have had like consistently good results with other companies that would be great. So we can put a list of recommended.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:11.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Printers, you know, 3rd party printers, but.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Whcc. Has been really good. I know there are others like Mpics. etc. I just can't speak to them, because I don't have the experience.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:35.000
Tamra M. Gentry: Thank you. I actually have a local guy um in chick in the Chicago land area, and he he calls himself a master printer, and I believe it. I want to do my own printing. But um, I mean for those the things that are size, I mean outside of my size range. I'm I'm.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Yeah, yeah, sure, if you're going to. Do, you know, run of a run of posters.

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:38.000
Tamra M. Gentry: Stepping on that. And yeah, yeah.

01:05:39.000 --> 01:05:41.000
Tamra M. Gentry: Yeah.

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:46.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And you don't know how much longer you're going to be printing. There's no point in spending 3 or 4 grand on a printer, so that's a good.

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.000
Tamra M. Gentry: Yeah, yeah.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And that's the best. Actually, I mean, I mentioned White House custom color. But if you've got a local printer, that's the best, because you can actually go there and.

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000
Tamra M. Gentry: Mhm.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000
Tamra M. Gentry: Exactly. Yeah.

01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:55.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: If he's if he's if he's good.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:57.000
Tamra M. Gentry: Mhm.

01:05:55.000 --> 01:06:00.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: He will, you know, make some test prints for you, and show you what it looks like, and and.

01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:00.000
Tamra M. Gentry: Mhm.

01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:04.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Won't, you know, will continue until you're happy, and that's the key.

01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:12.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: All right. Everyone. I think we are wrapped up for tonight. If anyone doesn't have any last minute questions, then.

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:15.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Hopefully, that was useful and helpful tonight.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Our next print lab will be in.

01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:21.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Approximately 3 to 4 weeks, and we'll keep.

01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:28.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Talking about different things again. Feel free to send in your questions. I pile them up, and then I can address them in the next.

01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:32.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: In the next print lab.

01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:39.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: And I think Jeff asked. The question about is the difference between white and pure white? Yes, I think I addressed that. But you know you're right. It's not.

01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:43.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Once you print it and put it on the wall. It's very hard to tell.

01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:47.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: All right. Everyone thanks again for.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:54.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Coming out tonight. Appreciate it, and see everyone who wants to join. On Wednesday for our next.

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:56.000
Robert Rodriguez Jr: Live session. Take care, have a good night.
