44455,Mastering Composition—Simplicity,"In this livestream, I explore the theme of simplicity in composition, particularly in nature and landscape photography where chaos often prevails.



Simplify images in the field, using digital tools, and during editing.


Avoid overworking an image to maintain freshness and impact.


Use the LCU framework: lead the viewer, establish a center of interest, and create a harmonious image.



Achieving and Simplifying Composition


Simplicity is achieved through contrast and variation in tonal values, colors, and shapes.



Example: Landscape photograph from Nova Scotia simplified by identifying broad shapes and converting to black and white.


Focus on three main shapes to guide the viewer's eye and create depth.


Emphasize the importance of maintaining simplicity while adding interest through variation.



Key Techniques for Simplicity and Depth



Foreground Interest: Create repetitive patterns to keep the viewer engaged.


Minimize Distractions: Simplify the background to maintain focus on the primary subject.


Tonality and Contrast: Darker elements appear closer, lighter elements recede.


Dominant Shapes: Define the frame and create visual connections within the image.


Dodging and Burning: Use these techniques to emphasize foreground shapes and create depth.


Black and White Conversion: Simplify the mood and enhance composition.



Revisiting and Refining


Revisiting your work allows for a fresh perspective and continuous improvement.



Fresh Perspective: Regularly revisit your work to identify areas for improvement.


Build Confidence: The process of creating, editing, and refining your images builds confidence.


Shape Interaction: Focus on how shapes interact and harmonize within the composition.



Conclusion



Simplicity isn't about the number of shapes but their interaction and harmony.


Aim for simplicity to make your work unique and engaging.",Composition,composition,https://youtube.com/live/WqA52Ao9NQk,,['composition'],https://youtube.com/live/WqA52Ao9NQk
44461,CC #08—Elements of Visual Design,"Understanding Composition Principles


Applying composition principles is crucial in landscape photography. While knowing the concepts is helpful, putting them into practice is where the magic happens. When I first started, composition felt very mechanical. But with practice and study, it became second nature.



One core principle I always emphasize is ""LCU"" (leading the viewer into the picture). It’s all about creating a path for the viewer's eye and establishing a center of interest.


Unity and harmony within the frame are essential, though a bit of tension and dynamics can add to the overall composition.


Remember, these principles are not original; they are a blend of ideas from various artists and photographers.






The Building Blocks: Elements of Design


Visual design principles like variation, rhythm, contrast, and movement are the effects we aim to create in our images. The elements we use to achieve these effects are lines, shapes, tones, colors, and textures.



Think of tones as the lightness and darkness in your image; they add visual interest.


When composing, focus on these elements rather than just labeling objects.






The Power of Lines


Lines are incredibly powerful in guiding the viewer's eye and creating movement within your image.



Horizontal and vertical lines provide stability, while diagonal lines introduce tension.


Lines can also enhance texture and depth, like in tidal pool reflections or landscape scenes.


Remember, lines are not just straight; they can be curved and winding, creating a sense of rhythm and movement.






Playing with Tonal Variation


Tonal variation, which refers to the lightness and darkness of elements, plays a huge role in creating contrast and movement.



Highlights and shadows draw the viewer's eye and add depth and energy.


For example, in a scene from Moab, Utah, I used sunlight and shadows to create a compelling image.


Silhouettes are a fantastic way to simplify complex scenes and create mood and atmosphere.






Shaping Your Composition


Shapes are fundamental in visual design, creating movement and depth in your photographs.



Where you place shapes in the frame can affect how the viewer perceives distance.


Backlighting can enhance tone, especially in black-and-white photography.


Shapes help create variation, patterns, and visual weight, adding rhythm and interest to your composition.






The Emotional Impact of Color


Color is subjective but incredibly impactful. Understanding how different colors affect mood can transform your photography.



Complementary colors (opposite on the color wheel) create dynamic movement.


Analogous colors (next to each other on the color wheel) create harmony.


Examples: Red and green, yellow and blue combinations can make certain areas of your image pop.






Adding Texture


Texture adds weight and interest to your images, but it must be used wisely.



Too much texture can overwhelm the viewer, so balance is key.


Use texture to guide the viewer's eye and create a balanced composition.


Contrasting textures, like grasses against a smooth background, can create depth and visual hierarchy.",Composition,composition|visual design,https://youtube.com/live/nyzT51C04l8,,"['composition', 'visual design']",https://youtube.com/live/nyzT51C04l8
44462,CC #09—Principles of Visual Design,"The overarching goal of visual design in photography is to create unity and lead the viewer through the image, establishing a center of interest.



The ultimate aim is to evoke a feeling or emotion, allowing viewers to connect deeply with the image.


Gaining control over the viewer’s gaze makes it easier to convey a message, tell a story, and evoke emotion.






Elements and Principles of Visual Design


Visual design consists of elements and principles that work together to create compelling images.



Elements like lines, shapes, tones, colors, and textures are the building blocks we capture in the field.


Principles such as contrast, movement, dominance, and pattern help arrange these elements to enhance the image.






Variation in Visual Design


Variation is key to creating movement and energy in an image, achieved through various elements.



Contrast, rhythm, dominance, movement, and pattern all contribute to variation.


Variation in shapes, sizes, distances, colors, and textures can make an image more engaging.


For example, a photograph of rocks can use variation in size, shape, and placement to create interest.


Post-processing tools like Lightroom can emphasize these principles through dodging and burning to create shadows and highlights.






Dominance in Visual Design


Dominance helps to simplify the message of the image by making certain elements stand out.



Dominance can be achieved through colors, shapes, and light.


Decide whether the sky or the land should be dominant to maintain a clear message.


Avoid cluttering the image with too many elements; simplicity is key.


Use shapes, size, and color to create dominance. For instance, trees placed from top to bottom of the frame can dominate a scene.


A wide-angle lens can enhance the size and perspective of foreground objects, creating dominance and distortion.


Color dominance can be achieved by using a single color with a small amount of contrasting color for interest.






Movement in Visual Design


Movement guides the viewer’s eye through the image, creating a sense of depth and dynamism.



Diagonals are effective in creating movement through the image.


Perspective lines can pull the viewer into the frame.


The placement of the horizon also influences movement and visual weight.






Pattern and Rhythm in Visual Design


Pattern and rhythm work together to create movement and interest in an image.



Patterns of similar elements can create movement and interest, but should not be too uniform or too random.


Black and white conversion can simplify the image, emphasizing pattern and rhythm.


Variation within the pattern, such as different angles of trees, adds to the composition’s appeal.






Contrast in Visual Design


Contrast creates variation and interest in a composition.



Types of contrast include light and dark, cool and warm, smooth and rough, and active and passive areas.


Light and dark contrast, for example, can create depth and lead the viewer’s eye through the composition.


Use contrast to balance the foreground and background, ensuring an engaging composition.


Diagonals can also lead the viewer through the picture, adding movement.






Personal Intuition and Enthusiasm


Your personal intuition and enthusiasm are vital in photography.



Focus on subjects that genuinely interest you.


There are no absolute rules in art; creativity should guide your work.


Learn from mistakes and view unsuccessful photographs as opportunities for growth.


Take your time with composition; rushing hinders learning and development.


Use visual design principles as guides, not strict rules, to enhance your understanding and intuition.






Key Takeaways



Focus on Shapes and Colors: Think of objects as shapes and colors rather than labeling them.


Establish a Focal Point: Create a mood or feeling that immerses the viewer.

44476,Mastering Composition—Learning From The Masters,"In this session, I delve into the core concepts of photographic composition: Simplicity, Edge Control, Light, Variations, and Rhythm. Additionally, I explore a bonus concept: Subtlety and Suggestion, emphasizing the importance of leaving room for interpretation and engaging the viewer.


Compositional Concepts



Simplicity:

""Less is more"" – removing distracting elements.


Example: An image by Galen Rowell illustrating simplicity.


Using simple shapes and negative space to create dynamic compositions.


Balance and visual weight guide the viewer's eye through the image.


In one of my images, I use a simple S-shape to guide the viewer’s eye, balancing visual weight to create a sense of movement.




Edge Control:

Being intentional about where you place the edges of your frame to redefine shapes.


Example: Fay Godwin's image using frame edges for triangular shapes and cloud patterns.


Foreground importance allows the viewer's eye to move through the composition.


In my own work, I carefully use the edges to guide the viewer’s eye through the composition.




Light:

Light creates shadows, highlights, shapes, and color, contributing to energy and movement.


Favoring side lighting and backlighting over front lighting.


Example: David Muench's use of light and shadows for depth and movement.


In my photography, I apply principles of light and shadow to create a sense of energy and movement.




Variations:

Contrasting elements in color, texture, and detail to create dynamic images.


Example: Ivan Shishkin and David Wench's paintings showing light and shadow contrasts.


Utilizing foreground, middle ground, and background to create depth.


In my work, I use long exposure to create variation between rocks and water.




Rhythm:

Movement and rhythm are related to patterns, shapes, and curves.


Repeating elements and groups of threes create visually appealing compositions.


Example: Thomas Hill's repetition of elements to guide the viewer's eye.


I use curves and circular patterns to create a smooth flow through the image.





Mastery


Studying the work of masters in photography and painting is crucial for learning about composition. By analyzing elements such as light, drama, subtlety, suggestion, and framing, you can develop your visual literacy and incorporate these principles into your work. Observing and studying great works provides inspiration and helps you refine your own style, ensuring that your compositions are both unique and compelling.

44482,Favorite Lightroom Workflow Tips & Strategies,"In this livestream, I delve into my favorite Lightroom workflow tips and strategies, focusing on image management, importing, cataloging, keywording, and other aspects to enhance efficiency in Lightroom. The primary goal is to let Lightroom handle the heavy lifting, allowing us to concentrate on creating and editing.


Lightroom Catalog and Previews


I store raw files on an external hard drive and manage them using a Lightroom catalog. The catalog consists of two key files: the catalog file, which references images, and the previews file, which generates high-quality previews of raw files. This setup allows for efficient image management and viewing.


Importing Images


When importing images, I recommend:



Setting ""Build Previews"" to ""1 to 1"" for full-size previews.


Enabling ""Build Smart Previews"" for older or slower computers.


Checking ""Don't Import Suspected Duplicates"" to avoid redundancy.


Adding custom text and relevant keywords during import.


Applying develop settings and copyright metadata to streamline workflow.



Organizing Images


All raw files are organized on an external hard drive by year and month. I prefer using metadata over folders for organizing images within Lightroom. Setting the preview size to match the screen size and ensuring high preview quality provides accurate image representation.


Using Lightroom Effectively


Customizing Lightroom’s view options and learning keyboard shortcuts can significantly enhance workflow efficiency.



Adjust grid size, thumbnail badges, and displayed information for streamlined review and editing.


Familiarize yourself with shortcuts for frequently used commands to save time and improve productivity.



Rating and Labeling Images


Using a number rating system and color labels helps categorize images effectively.



Use 2 to indicate standout images and 4 for well-edited images ready to share.


Color labels, such as red for portfolio images and green for panoramas, provide a granular way to organize and prioritize images.



Keywording and Filtering Images


Applying keywords to images is crucial for better organization and searchability.



Add keywords individually or to multiple images simultaneously.


Use keyword suggestions based on previous entries.


Enhance filtering ability with keywords for specific criteria like dates, camera models, and lenses.



Using Collections


Collections are a powerful tool for organizing images without moving files.



Use quick collections for easy grouping of images, converting them to regular collections for more permanent organization.


Smart Collections offer flexibility, especially useful for managing large numbers of images.



Backup and Storage


I store most images locally, with recent iPhone images in the cloud. Backing up all images on a local drive, a NAS drive, and a separate cloud service ensures extra security. When traveling, I use a portable drive to create a Lightroom catalog, importing images into the main catalog upon returning home to maintain organization and continuity.",Lightroom,Lightroom|workflow,https://youtube.com/live/C_F4zmba_Xg,,"['Lightroom', 'workflow']",https://youtube.com/live/C_F4zmba_Xg
44483,Favorite Lightroom Workflow Tips & Strategies Pt II,"In this video, I continue sharing my favorite Lightroom workflow tips and strategies, focusing on renaming images, Smart Collections, syncing settings, snapshots, virtual copies, exporting images, and more to optimize efficiency and organization.


Renaming Images During Import


Renaming images during import is essential for organization. I recommend using the ""File Renaming"" feature in the import dialogue to add relevant information like location or subject. This helps avoid duplication and makes searching easier. You can also rename files after importing, using custom text and date formats to maintain consistency across different cameras and SD cards.


Smart Collections


Smart Collections are dynamic and filter images based on specific criteria such as metadata, keywords, and file names. For instance, I created a Smart Collection called ""Trees"" to include all images with the keyword ""trees."" Keywording images upfront is crucial to leverage Smart Collections effectively. Built-in Smart Collections like ""Four Star Images"" and ""Past Month"" are useful, and you can customize their rules to fit your needs.


Syncing Settings


The ""Sync Settings"" feature allows you to copy specific Develop settings from one image to others. You can selectively sync adjustments by checking or unchecking boxes in the Sync Settings window. This feature saves time and ensures consistency across multiple images, especially when making similar adjustments like removing dust spots or applying color corrections.


Snapshots and Virtual Copies


Snapshots let you save different versions of an image at various editing stages, making it easy to switch between edits. Virtual copies create independent copies of an image with all current settings applied, allowing for multiple versions with unique edits. This is particularly useful for creating black and white versions alongside color counterparts without duplicating files.


Exporting Images


Lightroom's export presets define specific settings for exporting images, ensuring consistency. When exporting, you can rename files, choose file formats (JPEG, PNG, DNG), and adjust quality settings. For web use, always set the color space to sRGB. Presets streamline the export process for different platforms like Instagram, blogs, and websites.


Exporting Slideshows


Lightroom’s slideshow feature can be exported as a PDF or video, offering a professional way to present images. Customization options include adding strokes, shadows, text overlays, and intro screens. Exporting slideshows as PDFs provides a polished format for sharing images.


Syncing Images to the Cloud


Syncing images from a mobile device uses Creative Cloud storage, while syncing images already in your Classic catalog does not. This is because Lightroom creates a smart preview in the cloud, allowing for unlimited syncing without consuming storage. This feature enables access to your images and develop settings on mobile devices without using storage space.


Converting Raw Files


Converting raw files to DNG is not necessary unless sharing adjustments is required. Proprietary raw files are generally safe, but DNG can embed adjustments for easier sharing.


Sharing Collections


Syncing Lightroom collections to the cloud allows sharing with others, with options to download high-resolution JPEGs. The ""Don't Enlarge"" option in the export dialogue prevents upscaling images beyond their original size.",Lightroom,Lightroom|workflow,https://youtube.com/live/nU5MJnMYQQM,,"['Lightroom', 'workflow']",https://youtube.com/live/nU5MJnMYQQM

45002,LS 02: Mastering Composition: The Frame,"Summary


The Importance of the Frame: The frame is a crucial tool in photographic composition as it defines the boundaries of the image. It determines what is included or excluded, which directly impacts the relationships between the elements within the composition.


Horizon Line and Visual Relationships: The placement of the horizon line can change the entire dynamic of the photograph. Raising or lowering it adjusts the emphasis between the sky and the foreground, guiding the viewer's focus and simplifying the composition.


Active vs. Passive Areas: Corners of the frame are considered ""active"" areas that naturally draw the eye and create tension. In contrast, the edges, particularly the middle, are ""passive"" zones, offering calm and balance.


Simplifying Through Exclusion: Simplifying the image often involves removing unnecessary elements from the frame. This enhances the focus on the subject and ensures clarity in the visual storytelling.


Managing Tension and Release: Elements placed near or cut off by the edges of the frame create visual tension. Effective composition can use this tension to draw the viewer's eye and then release it, leading to a more energetic and dynamic image.


Choosing the Right Format: Different formats, such as vertical, horizontal, panoramic, or square, can greatly affect the composition. Selecting the appropriate format helps convey the subject and story in the most compelling way.

45066,LS 04 - Mastering Composition: Dominance & Simplicity,"Summary


In this livestream, I dive into two key concepts that are essential for mastering composition in photography: dominance and simplicity. My focus is to help you establish a clear story in your images by emphasizing what's most important and using simplicity to make that story shine.


Dominance: Every image should have a clear focus or subject that stands out. It’s about identifying the main story or emotion you want to convey before you even take the shot.


Simplicity: Less is more. By removing distractions and unnecessary elements, you make your image stronger and more focused.


Horizon Lines: Where you place the horizon changes the emphasis of your photo. A higher horizon makes the foreground more dominant, while a lower one emphasizes the sky.


Visual Weight: Different elements in a photo carry different ""weights."" Balancing these elements ensures the viewer knows what’s most important.


Exclusion: Simplify your image by excluding things that don’t add to the story. This makes the dominant elements even more impactful. Exclusion is the most effective way to simply an image.


Contrast: Use contrasts (light vs. dark, warm vs. cool colors) to highlight the dominant features and make them stand out.


Finally, remember that this is about storytelling. Composition is your tool to create images that resonate with your audience, and when you get the balance of dominance and simplicity right, your story becomes clear, powerful, and impactful.

In this livestream, I delve into the fundamentals of tonal value in photography, focusing on how to create impactful edits in Lightroom based. Key concepts we covered include:


• What is Tonal Value? A detailed look at tonal value as the amount of light in an image and its critical role in setting mood, depth, and dimensionality. 


• Practical Examples of Contrast: How high contrast creates drama and focus, while low contrast softens the image and sets a quieter tone.


• Lightroom Tools for Tonal Adjustments: A hands-on guide to using the Basic Panel (Exposure, Highlights, Shadows, Whites, Blacks), Tone Curve, and Dehaze to control tonal values.


• Balancing Tonal Value with Color: Exploring the interaction between tonal adjustments and color saturation.


• Developing a Thoughtful Workflow: The importance of planning tonal hierarchy to lead the viewer’s eye and achieve your creative vision.


Finally, I emphasize the importance of having an editing ‘plan’ based on your personal vision for your image. This approach is fundamental to your growth as a photographer, as it allows you to edit with purpose and clarity. Building this skill doesn't happen overnight—it takes time and patience, and that’s exactly what the Academy is here to support. 🙂

Key Topics Covered:



Paper Selection ApproachWe covered two ways to approach paper selection—paper-centric vs. image-centric. I prefer the image-centric approach, where the paper is chosen based on the feel and message of the image. It’s all about finding the right match for the mood you want to create.


Dmax and Paper TypesDmax is basically a measure of much the black a paper can reproduce. Matte papers have a lower Dmax and work well for softer, more subtle images, while non-matte papers (like Baryta) have a higher Dmax, giving you deeper blacks and more contrast.


Matching Paper to Aesthetic GoalsChoose paper based on the mood and story you want to tell. This can be challenging because it depends on how clear and effective you are about what you are trying to say with an image, and how effective your composition is. But it's the most rewarding part of photography and printing and the focus of the academy.

Summary


In this session I share my editing workflow for two images, including my ""composition-first"" approach to editing which for these images centered around the dramatic light in the images. I covered sharpening tools and masking to selectively sharpen details, adding depth and dimension, especially for prints.


There were some great questions including why I rarely show my sharpening process in Lightroom. The simple answer is that I think of sharpening as less of a creative adjustment and more of a technical adjustment, so I tend to skip over them when thinking about the bigger picture of telling a story. However, sharpening is definitely important, so I will make an effort to share that regularly in the future!

Academy Session Recap: 


Mastering Composition – Patterns & Rhythm


Hey everyone! Here’s a quick recap of our session on using patterns and rhythm to strengthen your compositions:



Patterns are any repeating element in your composition with


Rhythm is how patterns repeat - regular or irregular, smooth vs punctuated - suggests a ""tempo.""


We explored how patterns create structure, unity, and movement—guiding the viewer’s eye much like rhythm guides a listener in music.


We talked about visual tempo, using repetition and disruption to create a sense of direction and energy in an image.


I showed how I refined a composition of grass reflections, using pattern to simplify and clarify the visual message.


We discussed how the world is full of patterns, and how spotting them—subtle or obvious—can help you create more compelling, story-driven images.


Finally, I encouraged everyone to shoot with curiosity and trust your creative instincts—don’t get stuck editing in the field.



This is a deep and powerful aspect of composition, so where will be many more conversations about patterns and rhythm in future sessions!

",Composition,,,,[],
46032,LS 22: Creative Workflow—Patterns & Rhythm,"




Summary


In this session, I continued our deep dive into the creative use of pattern and rhythm—this time from a post-processing perspective. I demonstrated how I approach editing images in Lightroom where patterns play a central role, and how subtle adjustments in tone, contrast, and color can help clarify or enhance the rhythm of an image. We looked at both explicit patterns (like repeating structures or foliage) and discovered patterns that emerge through intentional framing and composition.


We also had a meaningful conversation at the end about what makes an element distracting in a photograph—and how that often depends on context and intention. I emphasized that not every visual element is inherently good or bad; it's about whether it supports or detracts from the flow and message of the image.


One thing I forgot to mention during the session—but want to offer here—is the use of my LCU framework as a practical tool for evaluating your images, especially when you’re unsure.Ask yourself:



Lead the viewer – Does the composition guide the eye with intention?


Center of interest – Is there a clear visual anchor or focal point?


Unity and harmony – Do all the elements feel cohesive, or is something pulling the viewer away?



This can bring helpful clarity when you're not sure whether something strengthens or weakens the image. It's a reliable way to check your compositional decisions against your creative intent.


Thanks to everyone who showed up and contributed thoughtful questions—it’s these kinds of discussions that make the Academy such a valuable place to learn and grow creatively.

Canon PRO-1100 Overview


A brief comparison between the PRO-1000 and the newer PRO-1100, with real print examples showing the subtle yet important differences in black density and paper handling. You can read my full review of the Pro-1100 here: 


Resolution Workflow in Lightroom


Why and when to:



Set output resolution manually (300 for Canon, 360 for Epson)


Double the printer’s native resolution (to 600/720) to avoid discarding detail


Let Lightroom handle interpolation rather than the printer driver



Super Resolution in Lightroom


How to use Lightroom’s Enhance > Super Resolution to upscale lower-resolution files when native resolution drops below 180 PPI for your print size.


Color Spaces and Gamut Explained


We used ColorThink Pro to visualize:



LAB and CIE color space structure


ProPhoto RGB vs. sRGB vs. specific paper profiles


How and why colors are compressed from your image to paper



Soft-Proofing Rendering Intents: Perceptual vs. Relative


We examined how Lightroom compresses out-of-gamut colors and when to choose each intent:



Perceptual tends to preserve overall tone relationships


Relative can retain accuracy but sometimes loses depth or contrast



How to soft proof effectively in Lightroom using side-by-side comparison:



Create a virtual copy for each paper


Use clarity selectively for matte papers



Installing Custom Media Types on Canon Printers


We walked through how to:



Enable easy and accurate paper selection when printing from Lightroom


Download and install AM1X files from Canson Infinity


Use Canon’s Media Configuration Tool to add papers directly into the printer driver

PS - Evaluation Image Discrepancy


During the live session I showed some test prints on my viewing station comparing the two printers where you could see a big difference in colors between the two prints. Here's an image that is much truer to what they actually look like. I think the discrepancy was caused by some light that was bouncing around my studio and affecting the video camera rendering. I'm working on a solution for the future.

Summary


In this session, we explored how variation and movement give a photograph its energy, flow, and emotional impact. Through a close look at classic images by master photographers—from Bresson and Weston to Cunningham and Adams—we examined how elements like line, tone, pattern, and form guide the viewer’s eye and shape the visual experience.


Thank you to everyone who participated live and shared their perspective on how each image resonated (or didn’t), and where their attention naturally gravitated. This wasn’t about finding a “right” answer, but about understanding how we all experience an image differently—and how that diversity of perception can sharpen our creative instincts.


Whether you attended or plan to watch the replay, I encourage you to pay attention not just to what you see, but how you see. That awareness is a powerful tool for building confidence and expressing your vision with greater clarity. And that’s the real value of studying so many different approaches—each one expands your capacity to see.

46119,LS 26: Creative Editing—Dynamics,"




Summary


In this session, I shared two recent images I made while visiting Acadia—both captured on my iPhone 15Pro. While my gear was limited, the creative opportunities weren’t. We talked about how working within constraints can actually sharpen your vision, and how thoughtful editing can elevate an image when you focus on what really matters.


We explored how to evoke a film-like look and also how to remain flexible in terms of compositional decisions. From there, we moved into a broader conversation about how editing shapes the emotional feel of a photo through tone, movement, and balance.


It’s not about fixing what’s wrong—it’s about amplifying what’s meaningful. Even small decisions in Lightroom can completely change the way an image flows and feels.


Editing Highlights from the Session:



Using the Tone Curve to create a soft, film-inspired look


Local adjustments to control where the eye moves (and where it doesn’t)


Letting “tension and release” guide contrast and light placement


Trusting simplicity—knowing when not to add more



Reflection Prompt:


Is there an image you’ve overlooked because it felt too “ordinary” at first? What happens if you revisit it with the goal of drawing out its hidden potential—not with fancy tools, but with clear intention?

Summary


In this session, we explored how to export your images for printing with a commercial print lab. I can't speak for others, but I can highly recommend http://whcc.com who I've used many times and will also provide you with test prints for approval before committing to a larger print(s).


We also talked about how to setup your printer and images to print custom notecards. I love and use Moab Artist Cards - https://www.moabpaper.com/artist-cards. Members also mention having good results with Red River Paper.


Key Takeaways:



Only use a third-party lab that others recommend or that provides test prints for approval.


When preparing files for external printing, export in the Adobe98 color space.


Check the native resolution of your file at the size you want to print to be sure it's large enough, and if not, use the Super Resolution feature (now found in the Detail panel) to upsize the file.

Working with the Lightroom Book Module


Summary


In this session, I talked about how to use Lightroom Classic’s Book Module to create your own photo books. I shared why I think books are such a meaningful way to bring closure to a project or portfolio, and how the process of laying out a book can deepen your understanding of your own work. Whether you were there live or watching the replay, I think you’ll find some ideas here to reflect on and apply to your own photography.


Key Takeaways



Creating a photo book gives your work a tangible, lasting form—something you can hold, share, and leave behind.


Lightroom’s Book Module makes book-making approachable without needing graphic design skills or extra software.


The process of sequencing images helps clarify your intent and strengthens your visual storytelling.


Captions and thoughtful layouts add context and personality to your images.


Even a short book with 20–30 strong images can be incredibly impactful and motivating.


Using collections and custom sort orders helps streamline the book-building process.


You can experiment with page backgrounds, typefaces, and layouts to make it truly yours.



Action Steps



Create a project collection in Lightroom with 15–30 images (or more) that feel connected.


Add basic captions or titles to your images using the metadata panel—this will save time later in the Book Module.


Open the Book Module and explore layout options—begin with a simple auto-layout, then refine it to suit your vision.

Summary


In this session, I walked through some of the most important new features in versions 14.4 and 14.5. I also demonstrated real-world edits on a few recent images to show how these updates can improve speed, control, and creative possibilities—especially around noise reduction, AI-powered tools, and sharpening. Whether you’re just catching the replay or revisiting the techniques, I hope you’ll find a few tools here to help refine your own process.


Key Takeaways



Generative Remove is better than ever Lightroom’s AI removal tool is faster and more accurate now—especially for removing distracting elements or people. You can cycle through variations or regenerate if you’re not happy with the first result.


Custom copy/paste subsets save time You can now create and save subsets of develop settings (like crop only, or basic tone only) for syncing or pasting across multiple images. Great for batch work and consistency.


GPU-accelerated previews improve performance Lightroom now uses your graphics card to speed up image previews when scrolling or zooming—especially helpful when reviewing large folders.


Denoise, Super Resolution, and Raw Details are now non-destructive These features are integrated into the Detail panel with simple checkboxes—no more duplicated files. You can turn them on or off at any time and fine-tune the amount.


New metadata filters for AI tools You can now filter or create Smart Collections for images that used tools like Denoise, Generative Remove, or AI masking. It’s a great way to track your edits and revisit images for printing.


Updated XMP writing behavior If you use sidecar files, Lightroom now delays writing them during intensive tasks to avoid slowing down your editing flow.



Sharpening sliders explained (finally!) I broke down the often-confusing sharpening tools—especially radius and detail—and showed how to visualize and apply them for better prints. (Tip: Use the Option key!)

Summary


In this Print Lab, I focused on one of my favorite subjects—fine art papers, especially matte papers. We explored how surface, tone, and texture play a role in the way a print feels and communicates your intent. I compared different Canson papers, from smooth surfaces like Rag Photographique to highly textured options like Aquarelle, and showed how each choice influences contrast, detail, and mood. Along the way, I also took time to answer member questions on everything from paper sizes to poster printing.


Key Takeaways



Matte vs. non-matte papers: Matte gives a softer, quieter, more painterly feel, while non-matte papers offer higher Dmax, deeper blacks, and a more photographic look.


Texture matters: Use textured papers when your image is full of detail and surface variation. Stick to smooth papers when you want to preserve soft gradations like skies or water.


Warm vs. cool papers: Differences are subtle—“warm” papers look slightly less bright, while “cool” papers feel more neutral/white. Often only noticeable side by side.


Choosing papers intentionally: The best paper depends on your image and the story you want to tell. Become an “expert in your images,” and the right material choice becomes much clearer.



Q+A Highlights



Joanne asked about paper sizes and calibration:

Use built-in defaults (letter, tabloid, A3+, etc.); custom sizes only when truly needed.


For monitor calibration, choose the native profile of your display (sRGB for standard, AdobeRGB for wide-gamut).




Carl brought up Canon’s Print & Layout plugin: in some cases it corrected overly saturated skies compared to Lightroom, likely due to color management differences.


Steve asked about MacOS updates and printer drivers: updating your OS is fine, but check whether your printer drivers support the latest version before upgrading.


Mildred asked how to tell which side of the paper to print on: lightly dampen your fingers and pinch—the sticky side is the coated, printable side.


Tamra asked about offering posters: for affordable fine art posters, I suggested lighter-weight papers like Canson Rag Photographique (210 gsm). They provide a fine art look without the cost of heavier papers. For larger runs, a local master printer or pro lab like WHCC is a great option.
