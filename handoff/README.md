### How to Take Over This Project

#### 1. Set Up Local Environment
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/robrodriguezjr/academy-ai.git
cd academy-ai

# Python backend setup
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start backend
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --port 8002 --reload

# In another terminal - Dashboard setup
cd academy-dashboard
npm install
npm start
```

#### 2. Understand the Architecture
- **Backend**: FastAPI app serving API endpoints (`app/main.py`)
- **Vector DB**: ChromaDB storing document embeddings (`data/chroma/`)
- **Indexing**: Python script processing documents (`scripts/build_index.py`)
- **WordPress**: Plugin for member chat interface (`academy-companion-wp-plugin/`)
- **Dashboard**: React admin interface (`academy-dashboard/`)

#### 3. Key Files to Review
```
app/main.py                 # All API endpoints
app/prompts.py             # System prompt for AI responses
