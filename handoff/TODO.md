## üìù Notes for Next Developer

### Quick Start Priority
1. Fix Railway deployment (check logs first)
2. Get documents indexed (even just 10 for testing)
3. Verify WordPress plugin works for real members
4. Set up monitoring to catch issues early

### Key Files to Understand
- `app/main.py` - All API logic
- `scripts/build_index.py` - Indexing pipeline
- `academy-dashboard/src/Dashboard.tsx` - Admin interface
- `academy-companion-wp-plugin/js/chat.js` - User interface

### Common Issues & Solutions
- **502 errors**: Usually database initialization or missing dependencies
- **Empty responses**: Check if ChromaDB has vectors (index-status endpoint)
- **Slow responses**: Check OpenAI API status, consider caching
- **Auth failures**: Verify ADMIN_TOKEN environment variable

### Testing Checklist Before Deploy
- [ ] Local indexing completes successfully
- [ ] API responds at /docs endpoint
- [ ] Dashboard loads without errors
- [ ] WordPress plugin connects to API
- [ ] At least one golden test passes
